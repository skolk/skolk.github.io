# About Sean

I make tools to help communities explore new horizons. I enjoy bringing people together in a variety of different environments to see what it means to thrive with a variety of constraints.

I seek the cold, water, and mountains.

## Philosophy

I believe in creating systems that help people succeed even when they fail. I'm interested in the intersection of technology, community building, and exploration. Whether it's developing hardware solutions, organizing sailing expeditions, or building tools for better planning, I'm driven by the idea that we can create more together than we could alone.

The concept of 'type 2 fun' - activities that aren't fun in the moment but are rewarding afterward - guides much of my approach to both personal adventures and professional projects. It's about finding that sweet spot just outside your comfort zone where real growth happens.
