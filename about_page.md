# About Sean

I make tools to help communities explore new horizons. I enjoy bringing people together in a variety of different environments to see what it means to thrive with a variety of constraints.

Currently, I'm Director of Grant Strategy at [REAP Climate Center](https://www.reapcenter.org/), leading strategic development for climate-focused bio-regenerative programs. I'm also Co-Founder of [Astraeus Ocean Systems](https://astraeusocean.com/), developing ocean technology for sustainable marine applications.

I seek the cold, water, and mountains.

## Explorations

My adventures and learning happen across three main areas:

**[Sailing](/sailing)** — Charter expeditions around the world, from the Seychelles to Croatia. Leading Boatless Sailing community for 40+ people who don't own boats but love blue water adventures.

**[Making](/making)** — Building everything from brain-slicing robots to tiny houses. Hardware engineering, electronics design, and fabrication across biotech, climate technology, and ocean systems.

**[Mountaineering](/mountaineering)** — Peaks climbed from Yosemite to Uganda, including Mt. Kenya's technical routes and glaciated equatorial climbing. Teaching progression from follower to leader.

## Professional Evolution

My career has evolved from hands-on hardware engineering (3Scan biotech, electronics design) to strategic technology development (PickNik Robotics business development) to climate technology and ocean systems (REAP Climate Center, Astraeus Ocean Systems).

**Current focus:** Scaling bio-regenerative solutions through strategic funding, developing sustainable marine systems, and applying technical skills to urgent environmental challenges.

**Core philosophy:** Complex challenges require collaborative solutions. The best innovations happen when diverse perspectives and skills come together around shared goals.

## Community Building

**Adventure Report** — Monthly storytelling breakfast running since 2014, bringing together people to share adventure experiences.

**Boatless Sailing** — Charter sailing expeditions for people who don't own boats, proving that shared adventures create lasting communities.

**Teaching and Mentoring** — Sharing skills in sailing, electronics, mountaineering, and community organizing.
