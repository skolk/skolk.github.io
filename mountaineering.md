# Mountaineering

The mountains teach patience, humility, and the value of preparation. Over the years, they've also taught me about leadership, risk management, and the difference between confidence and recklessness. Most importantly, they've shown me that the best adventures are shared ones.

## Peaks Climbed

**North America**
- Glacier Peak (2007) — First major mountain, learned about glacier travel
- Mt Washington Winter Ascent (2007) — Introduction to winter conditions and weather management
- Mt Mansfield Winter (2008) — Vermont's highest peak in challenging conditions
- Mt Tallac, California (2014) — Summer conditioning and Sierra Nevada introduction
- North Peak NE Ridge, Yosemite (2015) — 4th class climbing, technical rock skills
- Cathedral Peak NE Face, Yosemite (2015) — High-altitude rock climbing
- Mt Conness NE Ridge, Yosemite (2015) — 5th class climbing at altitude
- Mt Hood Pearly Gates (2015) — Pacific Northwest volcanism and ice climbing
- Mt Whitney Mountaineers Route (2016) — California's highest peak via technical route
- Mt Shasta Avalanche Gulch (2016) — Cascade volcano climbing
- Mt Rainier Disappointment Cleaver (2017) — Major glaciated peak, team climbing
- Dragontail Peak (2020) — Alpine rock climbing return after travel
- Mt Baker Coleman-Deming Route (2020) — Pacific Northwest glacier climbing

**South America**
- Cerro Pintor, Chile — Andean climbing experience
- Cerro Plomo, Chile (2012) — High point in life at the time, altitude and endurance challenge

**Africa**
- Mt Stanley, Uganda/DRC (2018) — Highest peak of Uganda and DRC, glaciated equatorial climbing
- Mt Kenya Nelion via Normal Route (2019) — SE face 5.8 climbing at 17,000 feet, second-highest peak in Africa

**Europe**
- Triglav, Slovenia (2018) — Slovenia's highest peak, European Alpine experience

**Central America**
- Cerro Chirripo, Costa Rica (2018) — Tropical high-altitude climbing

## Underground Exploration

**T.A.G. Region** (Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia)
- Valhalla Cave
- Neversink Pit
- Sinking Cove Cave
- Iliad Cave
- No Cave
- Cemetery Cave
- Rumbling Falls, Tennessee — 20-hour expedition, endurance and underground navigation

## Learning Progression

**Following to Leading** — The progression from following guides to leading expeditions teaches different skills at each stage. Following teaches technical skills and risk awareness. Leading teaches decision-making, group management, and accepting responsibility for others' safety.

**Shu-Ha-Ri Model** — Learning follows the traditional martial arts progression: Shu (follow the form), Ha (experiment with variations), Ri (internalize the principles). This applies to mountaineering techniques, risk assessment, and leadership development.

**Community and Mentorship** — Finding mentors willing to teach leadership skills, not just following skills. Building relationships with climbers who push your boundaries safely and provide constructive feedback.

## Technical Skills

**Rock Climbing** — Multi-pitch traditional climbing, anchor building, rescue techniques. Yosemite granite provided excellent training for complex technical terrain.

**Ice and Snow** — Glacier travel, crevasse rescue, ice climbing techniques. Pacific Northwest volcanoes and winter climbing in New England built cold-weather skills.

**High Altitude** — Acclimatization strategies, altitude illness recognition, expedition planning. African peaks provided equatorial high-altitude experience.

**Navigation and Route Finding** — Map and compass skills, GPS backup, weather interpretation, route selection under changing conditions.

## Philosophy and Approach

**Calculated Risk** — Mountaineering is about managing risk, not eliminating it. Understanding the difference between objective and subjective hazards, making decisions with incomplete information.

**Team Dynamics** — Mountains amplify group dynamics. Learning to communicate under stress, make decisions collectively, and support team members through challenging conditions.

**Environmental Respect** — Leave No Trace principles, understanding ecosystem fragility, respecting local communities and customs around sacred peaks.

**Preparation Over Gear** — Fitness, skills, and planning matter more than expensive equipment. The best gear won't save you if you lack fundamental skills.

## Memorable Experiences

**Mt Kenya Technical Climbing** — 20-pitch 5.8 route at 17,000 feet combined high-altitude endurance with technical rock skills. Multi-day approach through unique equatorial alpine environment.

**Mt Stanley Glaciated Equatorial Climbing** — Experiencing glaciers on the equator, complex logistics through Uganda and DRC, cultural immersion alongside mountaineering challenge.

**Yosemite Alpine Rock** — Learning to climb long technical routes efficiently, moving together over complex terrain, trusting partners completely.

**Winter Ascents** — New England winter climbing taught weather management, equipment systems, and the mental challenges of cold-weather mountaineering.

## Current Mountaineering

**Mentoring Others** — Sharing knowledge with aspiring mountaineers, emphasizing progression from follower to leader, helping others find their own style and approach.

**Route Planning** — Continuing to plan expeditions that combine technical challenge with cultural exploration and team building.

**Skill Development** — Always learning new techniques, staying current with safety practices, maintaining fitness for alpine challenges.

## Lessons from the Mountains

**Humility** — Mountains are bigger than you are. Weather, conditions, and circumstances beyond your control will determine success more than your ambition.

**Patience** — The mountains will be there tomorrow. Turning around because conditions aren't right requires more courage than continuing when you shouldn't.

**Community** — Solo achievements are possible, but shared experiences create lasting bonds and better stories.

**Systems Thinking** — Everything is connected: weather, snow conditions, team fitness, route choice, equipment, timing. Small decisions compound into major consequences.

## Advice for Aspiring Mountaineers

**Start with Mentors** — Find experienced climbers willing to teach leadership, not just technical skills. Pay them with attention, effort, and enthusiasm.

**Build Community** — Find your tribe of people who challenge you safely and share your approach to adventure. Consistency in partnerships builds trust and capability.

**Progress Systematically** — Each peak should teach skills applicable to the next challenge. Build on successes and learn from failures.

**Focus on Process** — Summit photos don't prove much. The process of preparation, execution, and reflection creates lasting capabilities.

**Respect the Consequences** — Mountaineering can have fatal mistakes. Understanding and accepting this responsibility shapes how you approach every decision.

*The mountains teach you about yourself in ways that few other activities can. They strip away pretense and reveal character under pressure. The best mountaineers are those who use these lessons to become better partners, leaders, and people.*
