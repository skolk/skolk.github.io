## Major Past Projects

### Sanivation (2011-2012)
Co-founded a sanitation-as-a-service company in Kenya. We developed solar ovens for heating and dehydrating human waste to render it inert. Went through Start-Up Chile incubator program. The company continued operations in Kenya and now serves 250+ households across East Africa.

### 3Scan (2013-2018)
First employee at a biomedical tech startup in San Francisco. Designed electronic sensors, actuators, and liquid handling systems for brain-slicing robots used in automated digital pathology. Led hardware engineering projects including PCB design and manufacturing scaling.

### The Halfway House
Built a tiny house from a shipping container in West Oakland. Learned about space design, electrical and water systems, and the challenges of alternative housing. Sold for approximately build cost of $8,000.

### HalfWay House Tiny House Building
Part of a West Oakland warehouse community with 14 other tiny house builders. Shared tools, knowledge, and resources while learning construction skills and sustainable living practices.

### Adventure Report (2014-present)

**Various Maker Projects**  
From water jet cutting and sheet metal work to 3D printing and laser cutting. Always exploring new fabrication techniques and their applications.

## Philosophy

Each project represents an experiment in bringing people together to solve problems or explore new possibilities. Whether it's developing technology, organizing expeditions, or building community, the goal is always to create systems that help people achieve more together than they could alone.
