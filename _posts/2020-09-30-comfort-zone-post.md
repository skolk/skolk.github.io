# Exploring Virtual Depths: How to Play with Your Comfort Zone

The concept of 'type 2 fun' was introduced to me when I first went caving: "it's like fun but different." Type 1 fun is fun now and fun later; type 2 is not fun now, but 'fun' later - a struggle that was worth it, delayed gratification toward pursuits you're striving for.

## The Perfect Teacher

I recently found a game that mastered this progression like nothing I've ever experienced: Subnautica. It's a survival game based on an aquatic alien planet that refuses to give you useful weapons and creates situations requiring you to constantly face your fears.

You're dropped onto an ocean planet in the literal shallows with your life raft as home base. You can see the ocean floor a few feet below, you're given little instruction, and you have the constraints of needing food, water, and oxygen, which creates time pressure.

## The Progression System

**Stage 1: Normalize the shallow**
The shallows are safe. There are a few aggressive animals, but they don't chase you far - they're protective of their space, not enemies. You could 'die,' but that's not really the challenge. Subnautica creates a comfortable, safe space to normalize.

**Stage 2: Venture deeper**
After a few hours, you realize the game requires you to venture deeper into your environment. Not only are there different resources and objectives, but there are new creatures... and it gets darker. You're scuba diving at hundreds of meters with air supply, food, and safety concerns.

**Stage 3: Master the unknown**
The 'levels' have more to do with whether you've upgraded your character or created ways to survive underwater. Often a new environment becomes available (it always was), and it's scary - there's a creature that moves too fast, you don't know how to fend them off, and you're time-stressed because you're running out of oxygen.

## The Learning Cycle

But as you keep going, you realize how the creature moves, you increase your air capacity, and you find new safe spots. You begin to understand your mental map (none is provided), and you aren't wasting time going the inefficient way.

**First**: You take in lots of data to create comfort and set a baseline for normal. That's stressful, that's outside your comfort zone.

**Then**: You find your safe speed, stability, and inch forward.

**Finally**: This process repeats as the game finds ways to challenge your progress with greater depths and more formidable creatures.

## Real-World Application

Subnautica is a game, but real life isn't - if you were diving hundreds of feet down and 'mess up,' you die. Which is why creating safe spaces to explore and tune your comfort dial from underwhelmed to overwhelmed, and then into the just-right 'flow,' is important.

## Ice Climbing Example

A few years ago, I attended an ice climbing festival with friends. All of us were climbers, and I had dabbled in ice climbing but had never led a serious pitch. The festival offers gear with classes to demo, giving you an environment to take you out of your comfort zone safely.

Of the four of us, we all took different paths:
- Those with the least experience stayed in guided classes on top rope all three days
- Others with more experience were off on their own by the weekend's end, climbing routes and experimenting with techniques we'd learned the day before

We were all turning our comfort dials, exploring what the right level of challenge was for us, finding type 2 fun and getting into flow - with too much stress letting us know to back off, and boredom as a gauge of when to try something harder.

## The Framework

**Find your baseline** in a new environment; wade in slowly. Jumping in can lead to stress and being overwhelmed.

**Slowly normalize** and gain awareness of the important cues of the environment.

**Take small steps** with consistent check-ins.

**Play with boundaries** - go deeper and track your response.

**Always keep enough oxygen** to get back to the surface.

Whether you're exploring a new location yourself or hosting an environment for others, create your safe space and play with the boundaries. It's a series of small steps that push you just outside your comfort zone - far enough to grow, but not so far that you're overwhelmed.
