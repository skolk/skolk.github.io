# Sailing the Adriatic from Split, Croatia

Split, Croatia. Kate and I had been hiking and climbing in the Alps (Slovenia, Germany, Austria, and Italy) for three weeks before making our way to Croatia. We arrived the eve of Croatia's World Cup game against England, and unbeknownst to us, during ULTRA - a city-wide electronic dance music festival taking place around the city with parties on boats in Split's harbor.

Our goal was to sail out of AMC Split Marina Saturday as early as possible and make way for one of Croatia's several hundred islands.

## Day 1: Split - Delayed Start
We weren't supposed to check into the marina until 4pm, which felt like losing an entire day of sailing. I talked my way onto the boat at 2pm, but we still didn't get checked out until about 4pm anyway.

There were probably 200+ boats of various sizes in the marina, and at least half were attempting to leave Saturday. However, the wind had picked up, and there was a World Cup game at 6pm. As we rushed to load the boat and go over a quick checkout, we realized the water tanks hadn't been filled.

We attempted to head out with our first Mediterranean moor, but before we'd even let off both stern lines, the bow started to dive leeward. With heavy conditions and our inexperience with the local setup, I admitted defeat and prepared to settle in for the night at the marina.

## Day 2: Split to Hvar
09:00 - After a night of heavy bass from the festival and sunrise revelers returning to their beds, Klemen and I prepared the boat. With slight help from our neighbor to spring around their bow, we were off at about 9am, motoring out of Split and into the Adriatic.

By 13:00, we set sail and headed for the Golden Horn, a crowded beach where we anchored under sail. The crew went ashore for an hour before winds picked up to 24kts. We sailed under heavy conditions to Stari Grad, a developed town, where I undertook my first Mediterranean moor (no anchor), backing in among other expensive rentals.

We had cafe and restaurant front seats. The crew dispersed, seeking wine and cheese, and met back for dinner.

## Day 3: Island Hopping
The next morning, after a cafe stop in town, we motored out to light wind with Christina at the helm and Ned and Sara trimming. We found wind two to three miles out and set sail on a close haul.

The wind continued to pick up as we pulled around Hvar's west point. We realized we didn't understand the terminology behind heading, course, and bearing, so we hove-to (a great teaching moment!), researched our options, and made for the Paklinski Islands.

We found that we were late by Croatian flotilla standards - all the moorings had been taken. After some communication issues between captain and helm, we pulled in the sails, put on the motor, and after two tries, set anchor near a restaurant mooring.

## Day 4: Weather Challenges
We learned we had lost a fender overnight and went over proper knot-tying for fenders (round turn and two half hitches). We motored out, set sail with a solid beam reach, and headed for Brna.

Brna turned out to be a sleepy town with a traditional Mediterranean moor quay, where the local dock man showed us how aggressively you can use your engine in tight quarters. We found wine and fish, and relaxed for the night.

## Day 5-7: Island Life and Return
The following days took us to Lastovo, where we anchored with a line to a tree to prevent swinging into neighboring boats. We encountered hornets that were aggressive enough to force us into the cabin until sunset.

From Lastovo we sailed to Komiza on Viz, where we snagged a mooring off the beach and spent time diving, hiking, and exploring the larger island town. Our final night was spent at Solta before the early morning motor back to Split.

## Lessons Learned

**Mediterranean mooring:** Very different from anchoring - backing into tight spaces between other boats requires confidence and practice.

**Weather forecasting:** The Croatian wind forecast wasn't particularly helpful; local knowledge proved more valuable.

**Communication:** Clear communication between captain and crew is essential, especially when maneuvering in tight quarters with other boats.

**Flexibility:** Having backup plans for anchoring and mooring is crucial when popular spots fill up.

## Logistics

We booked through Sailing Europe, which turned out to be Orvas Yachting in Split. Moorings in cities can cost around $50 USD per night but often include electricity, water, trash disposal, and showers.

Croatia requires a VHF license and sailing certificate. US Sailing Basic Cruising worked for me. There are resupply options on almost every island, so don't over-shop for food.

The Croatian islands offer some of the most beautiful sailing in the Mediterranean, but the combination of crowded anchorages, complex mooring systems, and unpredictable weather makes it a destination that rewards preparation and flexibility.
