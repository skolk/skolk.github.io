I'm writing this from Flo and Andrew's place after another weekend racing aboard Golux, still processing what happened out there. My legs are finally warming up, and I'm thinking about gaps - not the ones between my foul weather gear that let the cold in, but the knowledge gaps that racing exposes so brutally and quickly.

There's something about being on deck in 20 knots of wind, trying to reef the main while spray crashes over the bow, that strips away any illusions about what you know versus what you think you know. This weekend taught me as much about working with teams as it did about sail trim.

## When Authority Meets Learning

I watched Jake work with Holm on sailing techniques, and it struck me how much easier coaching becomes when you come from a position of clear authority. Jake has the experience, the knowledge, and most importantly, the confidence to say "here's what we need to do" when things get complicated. But where does that leave the rest of us who are still figuring things out?

Jake took the time to answer what I'm sure were obvious questions, hopping up to adjust the traveler in a way that surprised Holm, then explaining why we needed to travel down but not sheet out. He gave Holm the confidence to trust his crew while learning to drive the boat better. That's coaching - meeting someone where they are and helping them get where they want to go.

But the more interesting question is how the rest of us contribute when we're not the expert in the room. I realized it starts with forming a group mentality around better questions. Instead of pretending to know things I don't, I've been trying to frame what we want to accomplish and what we can improve on, then share those observations with everyone involved.

## The Technical Reality Check

Racing taught me quickly where my sail trim knowledge ended. I'd been sailing for years but still struggled with the basics when conditions got serious. The main sail, I learned, needs constant attention - letting off to point up, sheeting in to take on more wind, adjusting for every puff and header. Those top two tell tales on the trailing edge? They're supposed to flutter about half the time. Nobody had ever told me that.

The foresail seemed simpler at first - set it with the cars, trim for your point of sail, and you're mostly done except for tacking. But even there, I had assumptions about light and heavy air positioning that turned out to be wrong. Smaller sails want to be further forward, larger sails further back. If you see stalls, change and adjust. Simple in theory, harder when you're cranking winches that need four wraps just to catch the load.

I kept notes throughout the weekend because I knew I'd forget the details. The running backstay winches need to be completely off when they're loose because they don't slide well. The main halyard slips in the clutch, so you over-tighten slightly and watch it drop an inch. For reefing, you stop the crinkle about a foot above the boom, release the vang, and let the main sheet run until it's completely loose - there will be friction, more than you expect.

These aren't the kind of details you learn from books or YouTube videos. They're boat-specific, crew-specific, and they only make sense when you're doing them under pressure with people who know what they're talking about.

## The Feedback Loop

After we finished, I sent Beth and Holm a message asking for feedback on how I did, what I could improve, and what I should do less of. It felt vulnerable to ask directly, but I realized that's exactly the gap I needed to close. Too often we assume we know where we stand instead of actively seeking input from people who were watching us work.

The weekend had clear highs and lows that told their own story. Understanding how main sail trim actually works felt like a breakthrough, as did finally grasping inside versus outside jibes on the asymmetrical spinnaker. Going through a complete reefing process while racing gave me confidence I hadn't had before. The sunset and sunrise reminded me why we do this in the first place.

But my legs were cold again despite wearing everything I owned - socks, boots, leggings, foul weather gear over a warm upper body. I still haven't figured out the heat management puzzle for overnight racing. Maybe I just need to accept that foot warmers and back warmers aren't luxuries but necessities, and stop trying to tough it out.

## Acknowledgment as Team Building

What struck me most was how differently the weekend felt when we took time to acknowledge each other's contributions. Beth worked hard to bring the team together and make sure we took care of ourselves. That's not sailing technique, but it's what made everything else possible. Molly is heading off to sail the Great Lakes this summer with a new team, and hearing Jake's stories about their time together reminded me that these relationships extend far beyond any single race.

This kind of acknowledgment isn't just politeness - it's how teams build the trust they need when things get difficult. When you're surfing down swells at 18 knots and someone needs to make a quick decision about sail trim, you want to be sailing with people who've proven they care about the outcome and about each other.

## Beyond the Boat

I keep thinking about how these lessons apply everywhere teams come together under pressure. Whether you're working on marine conservation in the North Salish, building software, or organizing community events, the same patterns emerge. Some people have clear authority based on experience and knowledge. Others contribute through curiosity, careful observation, and willingness to do the work that needs doing.

The gaps you find today - technical, interpersonal, or otherwise - become the foundation for what you bring tomorrow. Jake worked with Holm from authority, but the rest of us work from questions, contribution, and the willingness to learn. Both are essential when you're trying to accomplish something challenging together.

Racing strips away comfortable assumptions and forces you to confront what you actually know versus what you think you know. But it also shows you how much faster you can learn when you're working with people who are invested in the outcome and willing to share what they've figured out.

The cold legs will eventually warm up. The knowledge gaps, with enough curiosity and good people to learn from, start filling themselves in.
