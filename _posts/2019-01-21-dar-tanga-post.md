# Dar to Tanga Race: Sailing Without an Engine

It had been on the long list to join a coastal race. I was introduced to Brendan through his step mother whom I met on a farm in Naivasha Kenya. She told me he was looking for sailors to join him in a race around Zanzibar to the town of Tanga - about a 250 mile race that has been running for over 50 years.

## The Catch

Oh, one more thing that Brendan forgot to mention as we prepared: the engine wasn't working. We joked that it was a sailing race, not a cruising race - but the implications hadn't quite dawned on me.

In the race there are two classes: Cruiser (use your motor) and Open (no motor, start to finish). You can be bumped from open to cruiser class if you turn your motor on, even in an emergency. This means no matter how light the wind or heavy the current, unless we were equipped to paddle, we would be under sail.

## The Boat

Brendan had acquired Vaka Lele, a 35-foot Morgan-based sloop, from a German expat who had sailed the globe twice after building the boat himself in New Zealand. With 11 inches of extra freeboard, it was one of the more difficult boats I've ever climbed up on.

## The Race

**Day 1:** After a chaotic start with 23 boats, we battled wind and waves for 6 hours, making up and falling behind with the sun setting at our backs. Cooking curry at a 20-30Â° heel in choppy waters while trying to keep the crew fed was no easy task.

**Day 2:** Our watch schedule was split into two-hour shifts. The wind went between gusty to almost dead. At times we changed sails between light-air spinnakers and our regular working sails. We sailed until sunrise, heading further northeast hoping to catch wind and avoid the current that would pull us back toward Zanzibar.

**Day 3:** We caught a pod of dolphins mixed with pilot whales around midday. When we finally got the spinnaker up, our speed doubled from 2-3 kts to almost 7 kts. The confidence boost was huge - earlier we were wondering if we could even make it back to Dar for our flights.

## The Challenge

The wind died as we approached Tanga. We were motorless and windless in the mouth of a shallow bay with warning buoys scattered about. We had 4 NM to go to the anchorage - it took 5 hours and left us all hot and miserable, arriving at 4am.

## Lessons Learned

**Current vs. wind:** If you know the wind will die, you have to use the current to help pull you along. Many of the currents aren't mapped as well as the wind, and local sailors know what to expect better than visitors.

**Sail handling:** We had several issues with sail changes and managing different configurations, which cost us time and distance.

**Safety considerations:** Not being able to use your engine changes the level of awareness required for decisions in light wind, around other boats, and lessens the margin for error a captain can accept.

## The Verdict

We won the most 'meritorious' award for our efforts - first race, last both times, and a DNF for grounding. Despite the challenges, sailing without a motor taught us about wind patterns, current management, and the pure essence of what sailing actually is.

The Dar es Salaam Yacht Club has been running this race for over 50 years, and the community of sailors in Tanzania is incredible. Sometimes the best adventures come from the things that don't go according to plan.
