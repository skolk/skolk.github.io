**Bring people together, explore, share, and make things.**

Craig Mod just kept making and doing, and putting things in public places… you can too.

Today I woke up on a dirt road, and tonight I sleep in a dirt parking lot. In between there were ferries, abandon mines, electrical fixes, and brief encounters with graduated ski patrollers. I've driven from Campbell River up to Mt. Cain by way of Quadra Island and its wonderful little Cafe Aroma. Flo and Andrew told us I'd like it there; and yet I'm concerned that there isn't… an obvious school.

## What I Listened To on the Drive

On the drive I listened to Hank Green tell MIT that what they do is Make, but what gives them hope is other people. I listened Craig Mod tell Rich Roll about his love of walks and how he packs them all in; how the Japanese have this word: **YUTORI** which means to have the space to have peace of mind; and how that can only come from having the ability to take risks and not crash: which he calls a safety net. The Japanese have universal health care, and don't bankrupt their people and that's how they can compete.

He also talked about teaching the youth about what they can do; taking very long walks 1 week at a time, and one month at a time; only focusing on the now; and writing every night 2-3k words. I'm trying that now to see how much I can write; what I can do, and what even ½ an hour takes me.

## On Creating and Shipping

I'm envious of Craig; not that I want to be him. His life sounds very hard; but that he produced and created, and put it out there. He created. He **CREATED**; and **SHIPPED**.

What would it look like to make the write up of working with small groups towards an end? What would it look like to be vulnerable enough to ask questions and talk to the people in the room? To be the goof and to connect, learn, and share?

## A Framework for Leading

The framework would look like: The Tao of leading; meeting people where they are and helping them get where they want to go. It's understanding, approaching, agreeing, and striving.

Read the book of John; learn how to 'resource' people.
