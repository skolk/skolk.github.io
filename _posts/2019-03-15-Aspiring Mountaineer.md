# A Letter to an Aspiring Mountaineer

A competent mountaineer knows how to lead, and going up with guides whose intention is guiding (not instructing) won't get you there. Following guides doesn't build leading skills when teaching you to follow.

Big mountains are sexy, but often not the places you learn to lead. It's the repetition of skills, the building of a risk model, and the communities that give you constructive feedback and push you to expand your boundaries.

## The Three Stages of Learning

### Shu State: Following the Form
A good way to start is by setting a baseline of agreed-upon actions (this is known as the 'shu' state in zen). Do as you're told (always use this knot) and apply it to your environment. It's important to stay within bounds when you don't understand the boundaries.

This is the following-a-guide state, and it isn't a one-time thing - it applies for each new skill you learn. You're always going back to the beginning; each new surface to climb, each new language to speak, each new tool to play with.

### Ha State: Experimenting with Jazz
After you've followed the form long enough and have defined the risks and uses of the skill, you realize you want to lead. You progress into the chasm of novice-intermediate syndrome, where you need to push your own boundaries and experiment to understand what the forms and 'truths' mean.

It's asking for instruction and then going out on your own. It's finding the boundaries yourself and suffering consequences of missteps that a guide would never let you take. It's building understanding of how far you want to push yourself and how you want to interact with others as your followers, equals, and betters.

This is known as the 'Ha' state in zen - putting jazz into your step. Seeing that the strict form was there for a reason, but that poetry has a purpose.

### Ri State: Mastering the Philosophy
Eventually, you'll make it out. You'll see that the long dark valley of effort, obscurity, hardship, and frustrating arguments over... what? It might end in you leaving, but if you keep going, you'll be in the 'Ri.'

The master who understood why the forms were important, who saw why leaving them is necessary, and who experimented with different hows and whys. The 'Ri' no longer needs to follow the forms because every act is instilled with the underlying philosophy of intention.

## Finding Your Community

This is where community helps - where the helpers are looking for the next generation and those who've crossed the commitment barriers. This is where time and energy need to be invested, and nothing but effort will give you understanding.

Find that fire that warms you. Find the camp with your right mentors, and pay them. Sometimes they need money, sometimes companionship, sometimes just a friend or student or someone to listen. But contribute, learn, and give back. Help keep that fire going.

## The Hard Truths

**The summit photo doesn't prove much.** Experienced climbers have turned around more than they've summited and have waited for days in small tents and cold huts.

**We don't 'have' to do this.** It's a sport of ego; we choose to do it, so go with heart and go for the right reasons - your reasons.

**The mountains will still be there.** There's no rush except the one you create.

## The Path Forward

Keep learning, talk to the old-timers, and be careful of the bold. Find a mentor willing to teach you so you can then lead yourself. Find the community that allows safe experimentation, is open, wants new members, and wants them to go places.

Be interested - the hard work isn't sexy. Show up every week and make sure people know where and who's welcome. The secret isn't in the gear or the routes; it's in the consistency and the community you build around shared experiences.

The mountains teach patience, humility, and the value of preparation. But most importantly, they teach you that the best adventures are shared ones, and the skills you learn can be applied far beyond the peaks you climb.

*Set intention, invite specifically, show up, and grow.*
