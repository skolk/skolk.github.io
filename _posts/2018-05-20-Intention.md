# The Intention Model: Values and Life Design

My wife and I did a deconstruction of the values and efforts I've created over the years to understand more about the model I didn't know I had for approaching the world. We were using the book "Design Your Life," but to be fair, Kate is also a Designer at IDEO, and her internal expertise pulled insights out of me that I definitely wouldn't have perceived if I had done this on my own.

While it would be great to find your own Human Centered Designer for your self-deconstruction, it might be easier to start with a good friend or an objective relation.

## The Design Your Life Approach

The book "Design Your Life" looks for ways to prototype and amass experience that is tangible rather than normative or aspirational. As much as you say you want to write a novel or become an artist, what is it that you already do, and have committed to?

In a subtle way, it's suggesting that you do the things you do for a reason, and you can change that reason, but it's easier to flow down the stream and make subtle turns than to pick a new river.

## The Deconstruction Process

We wrote out the projects that I loved working on, the ones where I felt the most in flow, the ones that brought me the most success, and the times I learned the most. We also explored which ones were the opposite - where I felt the most stress, the most downtrodden, the most trapped, and where I learned the least.

The point of the exercise wasn't to show what to focus on, but what I had done, and how it had resulted. It was a deconstruction of the past to better understand where the rocky road was and where the fast track is.

## The Sticky Note Method

We made hundreds of Post-it notes, then began grouping them into categories that seemed similar.

The act of using sticky notes was important because when we grouped them, it wasn't always a match, or it brought up points about them that we might or might not stay with. If they had been written in permanent form, there would have been erasing everywhere, hesitancy to play with the ideas.

Kate, my partner, is good at this. She does it for a living; I hadn't been subject to it before, and to be honest, I don't think the book we were going through would have been 'enough' to get through the difficult synthesis process.

## Multiple Models

She came up with several models, many of which, once assembled, we agreed didn't resemble a reality we could agree on, so we scrapped them.

This iteration process was crucial - the first few attempts to categorize my experiences and values didn't capture the underlying patterns. It took multiple tries to find a framework that actually explained my behavior and motivations.

## The Emerging Pattern

Through this process, several key themes emerged:

**Community Building:** Almost everything I was drawn to involved bringing people together around shared experiences or goals.

**Systems Thinking:** I was consistently interested in how things work together rather than isolated components.

**Learning Through Making:** My best experiences involved creating something tangible while learning new skills.

**Constraint-Driven Creativity:** I thrived when working within interesting limitations - whether budget, materials, or environmental constraints.

**Teaching and Sharing:** The projects I found most fulfilling involved passing knowledge or experiences on to others.

## The Intention Framework

What emerged was what we called the "Intention Model" - a way of approaching decisions and projects based on:

### 1. Community Impact
**Question:** How does this bring people together or serve a community need?

**Examples:**
- Adventure Report creates storytelling community
- Boatless Sailing brings people together for shared adventures
- Sanivation serves communities without access to sanitation

### 2. Systems Understanding
**Question:** How does this help me or others understand how things work?

**Examples:**
- Building electronics at 3Scan taught me about biotech systems
- Tiny house construction revealed how living spaces actually function
- Goal setting system shows how planning and accountability interact

### 3. Tangible Creation
**Question:** What concrete thing gets made or built?

**Examples:**
- Physical products (AuxBoard, tiny house)
- Events and gatherings (Adventure Report, sailing trips)
- Systems and processes (goal setting methodology)

### 4. Knowledge Transfer
**Question:** How does this experience or knowledge get shared with others?

**Examples:**
- Writing about experiences
- Teaching sailing and outdoor skills
- Mentoring in technical and community building

## Application to Decisions

This framework became a filter for future decisions:

**Career choices:** Do they allow for community building, systems thinking, creation, and teaching?

**Project selection:** Which opportunities align with multiple aspects of the intention model?

**Time allocation:** How can I structure my time to include all four elements?

**Goal setting:** Are my goals connected to my actual values rather than aspirational ideals?

## The Value of Professional Facilitation

Working with Kate, who brings professional design thinking skills, made this process much more effective than it would have been alone. Her ability to:

- Ask probing questions without judgment
- See patterns I couldn't see myself
- Push through the messy middle of the process
- Help synthesize complex information into useful frameworks

This experience convinced me that having outside perspective on your life and work is invaluable, whether from a professional coach, designer, therapist, or trusted friend with good process skills.

## Beyond Personal Application

The Intention Model has applications beyond personal life design:

**Team building:** Understanding what motivates team members and how to align projects with their values

**Community organizing:** Creating initiatives that serve multiple purposes and appeal to different motivations

**Product development:** Building things that serve real needs while creating connection and understanding

**Educational design:** Creating learning experiences that combine multiple types of engagement

## Ongoing Evolution

The model isn't static - it evolves as I have new experiences and gain new insights. The framework provides structure while remaining flexible enough to adapt.

Regular reflection using this framework helps me:
- Understand why some projects energize me while others drain me
- Make better decisions about opportunities and commitments
- Communicate my values and motivations to others
- Build teams and communities around shared intentions

## The Meta-Learning

Perhaps the most valuable insight was about the process itself: that taking time to understand your own patterns and motivations is worth the investment. Most of us operate on unconscious autopilot much of the time. Making those patterns explicit allows for more intentional choices.

The combination of rigorous process (design thinking methodology) and personal relationship (working with my partner) created conditions for insights that neither approach alone would have generated.

*Understanding your intentions isn't about constraining your choices - it's about making choices that align with who you actually are rather than who you think you should be.*
