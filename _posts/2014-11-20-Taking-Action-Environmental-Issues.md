# One Small Step: Taking Action on Environmental Issues

This past weekend I watched the documentary "Gasland" about a Pennsylvania man's investigation into hydraulic fracturing (fracking) around the US. He travels as far west as Wyoming, interviewing farmers and residents who have agreements with natural gas companies to drill on their land, or who live in towns where fracking is pervasive.

The most notable image is when a farmer lights his tap water on fire due to pollutants supposedly from local drilling. The film shows health issues with town populations, local animals, dying fish, and the political and social issues around communities that have endured fracking.

## The Frustration

Gasland is one of about 4 or 5 documentaries over the past 12 months that have made me angry, sad, and frustrated all at the same time. They present situations that aren't clearly 'evil' - society does benefit in some ways - but show the aggressiveness of capitalism and short-term thinking in how we interact with the world.

Only through frameworks like Hannah Arendt's "The Banality of Evil" does the situation make sense - how it could have come to be this way through the accumulation of many small, seemingly reasonable decisions.

## The Inspiration

In a separate part of my life, I've been enjoying Alastair Humphreys' writings on 'micro adventures,' which point out that adventure doesn't need to be an epic journey. It can be done in a night. A small step. An action with intention.

## The Problem

I believe one reason people feel frustrated with the world is they don't see a way to influence their reality. It's like hitting water. You donate money to campaigns and the same problems persist. Decades go by and systemic issues remain unchanged.

I'm tired of being just a sideline observer, but I'm scared that my efforts, time, and money will be stretched thin if I try to support all the causes I wish would change. I go to talks, events, dinners that ask for donations. Talk is cheap.

## The Solution

I want to act, even if it's small. Even if it's just my pebble. It will be unique, funny colored, awkward, and great.

So I'm going to put in my effort. Just a small effort, but an effort. I want to see what that small step feels like on those things that make me angry, mad, and disheartened. I want to see what happens when I spend one night a week on a project, much like I plan for bike camping on weeknights or peak climbing every week.

## The Framework

**Issue:** Identify something specific that bothers you
**Small actionable step:** What can you actually do about it?
**Person:** Who's going to do it? (You)

For me:
- **Issue:** Water quality (inspired by Gasland)
- **Small actionable step:** Monitor local water quality issues
- **Person:** Sean

## The Philosophy

The idea isn't to solve climate change or fix capitalism overnight. It's to find one concrete thing you can do that moves the needle, even slightly, on something you care about.

This connects to my broader belief in systems that help you succeed even when you fail. If you commit to spending one evening a week on environmental action, you'll accomplish more in a year than if you wait for the perfect moment to make a big impact.

## Beyond Individual Action

While individual action matters, the real power comes when many people take small steps simultaneously. The environmental movement succeeds when communities organize around shared values and concrete actions.

This is where my experience with social anchors applies - create regular gatherings where people can work on environmental issues together. Make it social, make it consistent, make it accessible.

## The Challenge

The challenge isn't identifying problems - there are plenty. The challenge is finding actions that are:
- **Concrete:** Specific enough that you can actually do them
- **Regular:** Sustainable over time, not just one-off efforts
- **Connected:** Part of larger movements for change
- **Personal:** Aligned with your skills and interests

## Starting Small

I don't know where this will lead, but I know that watching documentaries and feeling frustrated isn't enough anymore. Whether it's water quality monitoring, supporting local environmental groups, or organizing community action - the key is to start.

One small step. One night a week. One person taking action instead of just talking about action.

The environmental challenges we face are enormous, but they're made up of millions of individual decisions and actions. If we want different outcomes, we need different actions.

*Let's see where this goes.*
