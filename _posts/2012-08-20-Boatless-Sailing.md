# Boatless Sailing: Adventures for Those Who Don't Own Boats

Boats might be the best worst idea ever. They're floating houses, if houses could sink, rot, run into other houses, and cost more than your actual house. Being stuck in the same house with your temporary family for a week is like summer camp where everything that can come up does, and you can't run away because you're all sleeping less than 30 feet from each other.

## The Problem with Boat Ownership

I began sailing six years ago and immediately found it frustratingly amazing and one of the most rewarding group experiences I'd ever had. After a trip for almost two weeks in the Sacramento Delta, I realized I needed to get my own floating disaster, and quickly found myself with a 25-foot project boat and two co-owners.

We spent the next two years arguing, fighting, and paying money we didn't have on a boat that was fun but stretched between all of us. Since then, I've come to the conclusion that sailing other people's boats is great, even if you have to rent them, because owning your own boat (unless you're living on it) never seems to be worth the cost.

## The Charter Solution

My first charter was to Santa Catalina off the coast of LA. For one week we sailed, dove, spear fished, hiked, and feasted. It was a great trial run, and I was hooked on the idea of going to far-away places and bringing people together.

Since then, I've sailed in Thailand, Mexico, Croatia, and the Seychelles. I've taken classes with American Sailing to learn more about bareboat cruising and became licensed in radio operation. I've captained for over 50 people, and we haven't lost anyone yet.

## Why Charter Sailing Works

**No maintenance:** Someone else deals with broken engines, leaky hulls, and electrical problems.

**Global access:** You can sail in the Caribbean this winter and the Mediterranean next summer.

**Shared costs:** Split between 6-8 people, charter costs are often less than boat ownership.

**Professional maintenance:** Charter boats are maintained by professionals and inspected regularly.

**Try different boats:** Experience various boat types and sizes without commitment.

## Building the Community

Sailing brings lots of different skills together. It requires planning, boat knowledge, logistics, coordination, cooking, medical know-how, wildlife identification, and lots of interpersonal communication. Figuring out why everyone is on the trip is crucial - ensuring everyone feels safe and heard.

We have nightly crew reviews, one-on-one check-ups, and role changes for situations that aren't working out. Little things become big things, and unlike other activities, you literally have nowhere else to go. The elephants in the room have to be addressed, and crew members have to confront each other.

Due to this intensity, friendships are formed, and sometimes issues that have been underwater for a long time get brought up and resolved.

## The Learning Experience

**Navigation:** Learning to read charts, understand weather, and plan passages.

**Boat handling:** Docking, anchoring, sail trim, and emergency procedures.

**Cultural immersion:** Exploring places only accessible by boat, interacting with local communities.

**Team dynamics:** Managing group decisions, conflict resolution, and shared responsibilities.

**Self-reliance:** Problem-solving when you're far from shore and professional help.

## The Destinations

**Mexico (La Paz, Baja Sur):** Incredible wildlife, warm water, and friendly locals. Perfect for learning to sail in benign conditions.

**Thailand (Phuket):** Stunning limestone karsts, clear water, and amazing food. Cultural immersion with sailing.

**Croatia (Split/Dalmatian Coast):** Beautiful islands, excellent infrastructure, and reasonable costs. Mediterranean sailing at its best.

**Seychelles:** Pristine waters, incredible wildlife, and some of the world's most beautiful anchorages.

**Greece (Dodecanese):** Ancient history, reliable winds, and countless islands to explore.

## The Community Today

We're almost 40 people in our charter sailing group now. Many members have come back several times and sailed around the world with us. Some have gone on to race, others to learn fishing and cooking, and even acquire new skills outside of sailing like knot tying and taxonomy.

The group has become a way for people to:
- Experience blue water sailing without boat ownership
- Travel to destinations they might not visit otherwise
- Build skills and confidence on the water
- Form lasting friendships through shared adventure
- Learn about different cultures and ecosystems

## The Philosophy

Boatless Sailing proves that you don't need to own expensive equipment to have incredible adventures. Sometimes the sharing economy works better than ownership - you get access to better boats, more destinations, and shared expertise without the hassles of maintenance and storage.

More importantly, it's about bringing people together around shared experiences. The intensity of sailing - being dependent on each other, facing challenges together, exploring beautiful places - creates bonds that last long after you're back on dry land.

## Planning Your Own Adventure

If you're interested in charter sailing:

**Start local:** Learn basic sailing skills in familiar waters before going international.

**Choose your crew carefully:** Sailing compatibility matters more than friendship compatibility.

**Plan thoroughly:** Research destinations, weather patterns, and local customs.

**Embrace the challenges:** Things will go wrong, and that's often where the best stories come from.

**Focus on the experience:** The goal isn't to cover maximum distance - it's to have meaningful adventures.

We seem to have a trip every six months or so, and the locations keep getting weirder and more remote. The boats are getting bigger, the crews more experienced, and the adventures more ambitious.
