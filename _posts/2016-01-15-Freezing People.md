# Freezing People: A Winter Camping Experiment

This past weekend, 11 friends and I wound our way up to Lassen Volcanic National Park, the 'Forgotten National Park,' to test out the snow and see how suitable it was for keeping us warm. This turned out to be a horrible idea. Never go here, stay far, far away. Don't even go north of Sacramento - there's nothing to see up there.

That being said... woah. It was cold.

## The Concept

The idea for Freezing People was that interesting people will overcome barriers to go to interesting places. Anywhere you can just 'pay' to get to becomes less about the journey and what you 'can' bring, and more about how much you can spend for the experience.

Events like Burning Man (initially), Ephemerisle, and Rainbow gatherings exhibit this principle. Rather than 'let's go build igloos and sleep in a cabin,' the event became: let's travel somewhere semi-accessible and explore how we operate without our normal comforts.

## The Challenge

When the journey dictates that you consider what you can bring with you, the importance of every object takes on more gravity. At Freezing People, your most valuable object is your sleeping bag - without it, you actually can't survive the night. Next might be your stove, the only way to get water when all other liquid sources are frozen.

## Day 1: The Approach

Four of us went up Thursday, realizing it was raining that night and most of Friday, so we hung out around Redding, reading and preparing until Friday night. We arrived at the South entrance at 4pm to what was probably technically snow, but might be better described as falling slush.

There was already a 15ft base layer of snow, so transportation wasn't the issue - comfort was. Of the 6 of us there, 5 decided to try hauling sleds, which we had to assemble and test in the rain/sleet/slush darkness.

This took two hours, so we left the parking lot around 6pm in the sleet/slush/rain darkness, hovering around 32Â°F - unfortunately the worst temperature it can be.

After 2 miles, lots of group separation, and extremely sore hip flexors, the rear guard called it a night. We set up camp in the dark and crashed hard.

## Day 2: The Build

Sleeping in the snow isn't all that different from 'normal' camping, except in sub-freezing temperatures, the only way to dry anything is to put it in your sleeping bag with you. This includes keeping any water you want liquid the next day.

We slept until 9am, and some of the group left around 10am. We still had 2,000 feet to gain and at least 2 miles to our destination of Lake Helen.

The ways people expressed themselves at an event like this were in 'how' they approached the task at hand. Some brought skis, others snowshoes, some had sleds, others went ultra-light and counted every ounce. We all brought shovels to dig snow and pat down areas to sleep.

Some were comfortable enough to just keep warm and dry, and that consumed most of their time and effort. Others needed a bit more and dug out a snow cave that could hold nine people.

## Day 3: The Elements

Night dropped temperatures down into the teens as we heated mulled wine, whiskey, and assortments of high-fat, high-protein dinners. Topics around the camp stoves included whether we could feel our hands, how best to keep feet warm, and what the idea of 'fun' actually is.

Weather was against us - the event was supposed to be three nights of camping and time to explore around the lake, possibly even summit Lassen Peak. However, acknowledging that fighting weather is futile, we hunkered down and enjoyed building our cave, meeting people who were sleeping 'on' snow for the first time, and learning how to keep ourselves warm (and alive) in frozen wilderness.

## The Philosophy

Having anywhere for people to sit out of the wind and be even slightly warmed (in a snow cave!) is a blessing when tents are as small as they are. As it turns out, only one of us had ever constructed such a dwelling before.

The next day, as quick as it came, had us slowly packing up to head down the 6-mile trail, skiers in the lead taking real turns down. It was sunny and bright as the day before, all 12 of us observing different methods of winter travel and styles of warmth.

## Lessons Learned

**Constraints create community:** When survival requires cooperation, people come together naturally.

**Gear matters, but adaptability matters more:** The best equipment won't save you if you can't adapt to changing conditions.

**Shared suffering builds bonds:** The people who endure challenges together form lasting connections.

**Respect the environment:** Winter wilderness demands humility and preparation.

We traveled back without incident to beers and warmth at Chico's brewery. New friendships made, new trips to be planned.

The event proved that interesting people will indeed overcome significant barriers to reach interesting places, and that sometimes the most memorable experiences come from the most uncomfortable circumstances.

*Until next freeze - thanks to all who made this possible.*
