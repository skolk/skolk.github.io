# Maker Projects and Experiments at TechShop

Over my time at TechShop, I worked on dozens of small projects that taught me about digital fabrication, design thinking, and the process of turning ideas into physical objects. These weren't always successful, but each taught valuable lessons about making.

## Pods in Pods

I made some smaller plant pods, and then put them in a bigger plant pod. Life is awesome! This gave me some cool ideas for nested growing systems and modular plant containers.

The concept was simple: create plant holders that could work individually or as part of larger systems. By designing components that nested inside each other, you could:
- **Scale up or down** based on available space
- **Experiment with different arrangements** without starting from scratch
- **Use consistent mounting systems** across different sizes
- **Create visual harmony** through repeated forms

This project taught me about:
- **Parametric design:** How changing one dimension affects all others
- **Material efficiency:** Nesting cuts to minimize waste
- **Assembly systems:** How parts fit together and stay together
- **User flexibility:** Designing for multiple use cases

## Stars for Awesome People

Today I saw a post on Reddit and realized that someone could use some support, so I took their wording and did a simple cut. Joy to the world.

Sometimes the best maker projects are the ones that respond to immediate human needs. This project was about:
- **Rapid response:** Going from idea to finished object in hours
- **Emotional design:** Creating something that would lift someone's spirits
- **Community support:** Using making skills to help others
- **Simple gestures:** Proving that small acts can have big impact

The laser cutter made this possible - taking text from an online post and turning it into a physical object that could be mailed to someone having a difficult time.

## Re-take on Herba Natantes

A friend asked for 'one of those air plant holders' and I couldn't bring myself to make it out of chipboard again (it was a phase), so I made it out of 1/8 inch birch. Then decided to make another one on the outside... then a lab worker said I should turn them into gears. Which would be cool...

This project showed the evolution of an idea:
- **Version 1:** Chipboard prototype (cheap, quick, ugly)
- **Version 2:** Birch upgrade (nicer materials, better finish)
- **Version 3:** Nested design (more complex, visually interesting)
- **Future version:** Functional gears (mechanical interest)

The progression taught me about:
- **Material progression:** Starting cheap and upgrading as the design proves itself
- **Design evolution:** How one project leads to the next
- **External input:** How other people's suggestions can spark new directions
- **Functional aesthetics:** Making things that are both beautiful and mechanically interesting

## Lux Auctus (Light Enhanced)

I decided I wanted a deviation from the industrial art that I'd been playing with for so long, and transition to organic and transparent.

Besides the fact that mason jars excite me (in the same way that shipping containers and wood pallets do), I found jars within jars humorous and somewhat challenging. It turns out that mason jars, despite having several different sizes, have relatively uniform lids (which is convenient if you lose a lid).

**The challenge:** Placing a jar in a jar resulted in a search for off-sized jars and metal cutting tools capable of perforating thin metal cleanly. I would not say I succeeded in the second part, but am happy with my first draft.

**Technical considerations:**
- The light inside the smaller jar was a compact fluorescent and got quite hot
- LED alternatives would be safer and more efficient
- The hanging mechanism needed to be more sturdy
- A cover for the top would improve the aesthetics

**Design lessons:**
- **Thermal management:** Heat generation affects material choice and safety
- **Structural integrity:** Hanging systems need to account for dynamic loads
- **Material compatibility:** Different materials expand and contract at different rates
- **Safety considerations:** Electrical projects require extra attention to fire and shock hazards

## Water Jet and Sheet Metal Bending

I was learning how to use the water jet at TechShop for my first trial - making a holding case for a water filter process we used at work. Not the most artistic object, but one that required a high amount of accuracy (if I was to use rivets).

**Material insights:**
22-gauge steel, after you cut it, is quite flimsy - good for bending but prone to minor dings if you don't handle it correctly. This meant making another piece the next day when I wasn't careful enough with the first one.

**Process learnings:**
- **Precision requirements:** Some projects demand much tighter tolerances than others
- **Material handling:** Thin materials require different handling techniques
- **Tool selection:** Water jet cutting produces different edge qualities than laser cutting
- **Fixturing:** Holding thin materials for secondary operations can be challenging

## The Meta-Learning

These smaller projects taught lessons that applied to larger work:

### Design Process
- **Iteration is essential:** First versions are rarely the best versions
- **Materials matter:** The choice of material affects every other design decision
- **Constraints drive creativity:** Limitations often lead to better solutions
- **External input helps:** Other people see possibilities you miss

### Manufacturing Reality
- **Tools have personalities:** Each machine has its own capabilities and limitations
- **Material properties are real:** Engineering properties affect what's possible
- **Safety comes first:** Especially with electrical and mechanical systems
- **Quality takes time:** Rushing usually leads to re-work

### Community and Learning
- **Share your work:** Showing projects in progress invites helpful feedback
- **Help others:** Supporting community members creates a positive cycle
- **Document everything:** Taking photos and notes helps you remember what you learned
- **Embrace failure:** Failed projects often teach more than successful ones

## The Joy of Small Projects

While big projects get attention, small projects offer unique benefits:

**Low stakes experimentation:** You can try risky approaches without major consequences
**Quick feedback loops:** Rapid iteration teaches faster than long development cycles
**Skill building:** Each small project adds to your capabilities
**Creative freedom:** Less planning means more room for spontaneous inspiration

## Integration with Larger Work

These maker experiments directly influenced my later work:

**Electronics design:** Understanding materials and manufacturing processes
**Product development:** Knowing how prototypes relate to final products
**Problem-solving approaches:** Using physical making to work through conceptual challenges
**Community building:** Seeing how shared making spaces foster collaboration

## The Maker Movement Context

These projects were part of the broader maker movement that was transforming how people relate to technology and manufacturing:

**Democratized tools:** Access to industrial equipment for individual creators
**Digital-physical integration:** Seamless workflow from computer design to physical object
**Community learning:** Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing in shared spaces
**Rapid prototyping:** Ability to test ideas quickly and cheaply

The small projects at TechShop weren't just about making things - they were about learning to think through materials, developing confidence with tools, and understanding how ideas become reality.

*Sometimes the most important projects are the ones that don't seem important at the time - the experiments that teach you how to experiment.*
