# Social Anchors: Why People Come Together

A social anchor is why people come together.

I began my social experiments in bringing people together in university when I realized the club I wanted to join didn't exist.

## Learning from Fraternities

Seeing how fraternities used large houses, parties, beer, and music to attract a social scene I wasn't interested in, I found other groups who framed their interactions around biking, climbing, or Spanish. I didn't realize it at the time, but seeing what fraternities offered was great insight into what many other groups didn't.

Even when people come together for a cause, that doesn't mean the group itself is welcoming or inclusive. Some groups are intentionally exclusive, possibly with good cause.

## The Inclusion/Exclusion Tension

Hashers - "a drinking club with a running problem" - ensure they know who's in and who's out with songs, special names, and being grotesque enough to shake out those who aren't interested. There are tensions between being too inclusive (ending in lack of identity) and being too exclusive (calcifying with no new blood).

Treading that line is difficult: creating the right set and setting for an event, the correct balance of people who know each other and those who want to meet people, determining how objective-oriented the occasion should be, and choosing the organizational medium for gathering.

## My Experiment

I had stumbled upon an outdoor group that was great on weekends but didn't have much going on the rest of the week. Communication channels were monitored, and the group meant for college students had aged into alumni with different wants and needs.

I started a weekly social gathering, which turned into several houses forming, a new sport group being organized, and a school bus being purchased. The secret was showing up every week and making sure people knew where and who was welcome.

## The Formula

**Set intention** - Be clear about what you're creating and why
**Invite specifically** - Don't just broadcast; personally invite people
**Show up** - Consistency is everything
**Grow thoughtfully** - Balance newcomers with regulars

## Key Insights

**Consistency beats perfection:** A mediocre event that happens every week beats an amazing event that happens sporadically.

**Lower the barriers:** Make it easy for people to participate. Remove friction wherever possible.

**Create traditions:** Small rituals and inside jokes help build group identity.

**Know your capacity:** Understand how many people you can handle and plan accordingly.

**Have an exit strategy:** Sometimes groups evolve beyond their original purpose, and that's okay.

The most successful communities I've seen have clear social anchors - whether it's Adventure Report's monthly storytelling, Boatless Sailing's global expeditions, or even simple weekly gatherings. People need a reason to come, but more importantly, they need a reason to come back.

*The mountains will still be there, the adventures will happen, but the community you build around shared experiences - that's what makes it all meaningful.*
