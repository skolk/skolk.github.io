# Fall 2019 Intention Setting and Life Update

Hello Friends and Family!

It's Fall 2019, and I thought it's been long enough since I sent out an all-comms update.

## Catching Up

It's been quite the year - in fact, it's been quite the year and a half. As most of you know, Kate and I left San Francisco last summer and spent the following period in Europe and Africa. I'll cut it off at the start of 2019, but to keep it short:

**Major Adventures:**
- Climbed the glaciated Mt. Stanley, the high point of Uganda and the DRC
- Saw chimpanzees in the Central African rainforest
- Climbed Mt. Kenya via the 20-pitch 5.8 route at 17,000 ft (the 2nd highest point in Africa)
- Attended the online altMBA program
- Participated in AfrikaBurn as a construction hand on Octocrab and became an AfrikaBurn Ranger

**Recent Travels:**
- Spent time in Mauritius
- Went sailing in Greece for two weeks
- Had a month back in the US
- Returned to Kenya, packed up the house, sold everything
- Went hiking around Scotland and the Manchester area for two weeks

**Burning Man 2019:**
- Passed Black Rock Ranger alpha certification
- Assisted as a Green Dot ranger (helping those in overwhelmed states)
- Camped with Burners Without Borders as co-build lead of their 100-person camp

## The Now

Now I'm back in San Francisco with Kate, where she's leading IDEO's build of the Digital Dream Lab. We're looking for housing in San Francisco while I search for my next career opportunity.

We're staying with friends around the San Francisco and potentially Oakland area. House hunting in SF isn't all that fun, and I don't recommend it - especially when one of you has a job! It's been stressful, to be honest, and we might find a less-than-ideal situation to allow me to focus on job searches and work that comes up in between.

## Job Search Focus

Job-wise, I'm looking for a way to work with a group that's facing challenging problems in the environmental and generative space. Ocean tech is attractive at the moment, but I've also been looking at energy companies and groups that are making hardware tools to better solve problems that cause industrial waste and affect how we consume and generate.

For the past half-decade, I've learned how to lead hardware engineering projects with mechanical systems and electronic development. I see myself as understanding how to build and would like to play in the human engineering side - working with teams and understanding problem spaces, rather than only building on the engineering side.

I know that's broad: I want to help people solve problems with systems, automation, and teams. I'm job searching. If you think my background would be attractive to a group or person you know, I'd love to be in touch.

## The Next 3 Months

My current 'day job' is job searching.

**Personal Projects:**
- Spending time climbing at Mission Cliffs in the mornings
- Planning to run 100 miles in October while also not drinking that month
- Participating in Inktober (daily drawing challenge)

**Schedule Constraints:**
Kate is taking a yoga class during the weekends, so we won't be traveling until December. This forces me into focusing 10+ hours minimum on weekends on my side projects (and intentionally not looking for jobs during that time).

## Intention Setting Philosophy

Above is my calendar of 'intent' - we'll see how that all goes; I'll let you know December 21st!

This connects to my broader goal-setting system that I've been refining over the years:

**The Circle Concept:** I've always thought of the calendar as a circle, maybe from a calendar I saw in elementary school. With the New Year at the bottom and Spring/Summer at the top, like a clock. When I plan my years, it looks like that.

A friend told me he extrapolated it into a helix seen from two dimensions with the years flowing into each other. A calendar helps you see how much time any one item takes. I work in weeks and weekends - if the goal I have can't be worked on once a week or weekend (lots of my goals are trips), then it's not approachable.

**Systems Over Goals:** Quantity over quality leads to quality (draw 20 pictures to get to your 3 masterpieces).

**Planning Principles:**
- Plan like you need it
- Make a lot of plans
- Accept that you can only do one thing at a time
- Commit to a few of them
- Turn it into a system
- Set a due date
- Create accountability
- Get excited about it
- Put it on paper
- Tell those who matter
- One step a day

## Current Challenges

**Housing:** San Francisco real estate is brutal, especially when trying to coordinate two careers and social connections.

**Career Transition:** Moving from hands-on engineering to more strategic/systems thinking roles requires finding the right opportunity and team.

**Balancing Act:** Managing job search intensity with personal projects and relationship needs.

## Looking Forward

The next few months are about finding the right opportunity that aligns with my values and experience. I'm looking for work that combines:

- **Technical challenge:** Problems that require systems thinking and engineering solutions
- **Environmental impact:** Work that addresses climate change and sustainability
- **Team leadership:** Opportunities to help groups solve complex problems together
- **Community benefit:** Projects that serve broader social good

## Lessons from the Road

This year and a half of travel and adventure reinforced some key insights:

**Adventure builds perspective:** Climbing mountains in Africa and sailing in Greece reminded me that most day-to-day stress is self-created.

**Community is everything:** Whether it's rangers at Burning Man or sailing crews in Greece, the best experiences happen when people work together toward shared goals.

**Systems thinking applies everywhere:** From organizing 100-person camps to navigating African bureaucracy, understanding how systems work (and don't work) is crucial.

**Constraints breed creativity:** Limited resources and challenging environments often produce the most innovative solutions.

## The Bigger Picture

This transition period is really about aligning career with values. After years of building technical skills and gaining experience, I want to work on problems that matter with people who share similar values around sustainability, community, and systems thinking.

The job search isn't just about finding employment - it's about finding the right platform to apply everything I've learned about engineering, community building, and problem-solving to challenges that matter.

## How You Can Help

If you know of opportunities in:
- Ocean technology and environmental monitoring
- Sustainable energy and industrial efficiency
- Hardware companies focused on environmental solutions
- Teams working on climate change adaptation
- Organizations building tools for community resilience

I'd love to connect. I'm particularly interested in roles that combine technical problem-solving with team leadership and strategic thinking.

## Staying Connected

I'll send updates on how this all unfolds. If you're in the San Francisco area and want to catch up over coffee or a climb, let me know. If you're elsewhere and planning adventures, keep me in the loop - there's always room for one more sailor, climber, or community builder.

Thanks for following along on this journey. The adventure continues, just in a different format.

## Resources

- **Resume and portfolio:** Available upon request
- **LinkedIn:** [Your profile here]
- **Current projects:** Adventure Report (still running monthly), various sailing expeditions in planning

The calendar of intent for the next quarter is ambitious but achievable. By December 21st, I'll know how well this intention-setting approach worked for a major life transition.

*Set intention, invite specifically, show up, and grow.*
