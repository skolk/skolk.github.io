# Fall 2019 Intention Setting and Life Update

Hello Friends and Family!

It's Fall 2019, and I thought it's been long enough since I sent out an all-comms update.

## Catching Up

It's been quite the year - in fact, it's been quite the year and a half. As most of you know, Kate and I left San Francisco last summer and spent the following period in Europe and Africa. I'll cut it off at the start of 2019, but to keep it short:

**Major Adventures:**
- Climbed the glaciated Mt. Stanley, the high point of Uganda and the DRC
- Saw chimpanzees in the Central African rainforest
- Climbed Mt. Kenya via the 20-pitch 5.8 route at 17,000 ft (the 2nd highest point in Africa)
- Attended the online altMBA program
- Participated in AfrikaBurn as a construction hand on Octocrab and became an AfrikaBurn Ranger

**Recent Travels:**
- Spent time in Mauritius
- Went sailing in Greece for two weeks
- Had a month back in the US
- Returned to Kenya, packed up the house, sold everything
- Went hiking around Scotland and the Manchester area for two weeks

**Burning Man 2019:**
- Passed Black Rock Ranger alpha certification
- Assisted as a Green Dot ranger (helping those in overwhelmed states)
- Camped with Burners Without Borders as co-build lead of their 100-person camp

## The Now

Now I'm back in San Francisco with Kate, where she's leading IDEO's build of the Digital Dream Lab. We're looking for housing in San Francisco while I search for my next career opportunity.

We're staying with friends around the San Francisco and potentially Oakland area. House hunting in SF isn't all that fun, and I don't recommend it - especially when one of you has a job! It's been stressful, to be honest, and we might find a less-than-ideal situation to allow me to focus on job searches and work that comes up in between.

## Job Search Focus

Job-wise, I'm looking for a way to work with a group that's facing challenging problems in the environmental and generative space. Ocean tech is attractive at the moment, but I've also been looking at energy companies and groups that are making hardware tools to better solve problems that cause industrial waste and affect how we consume and generate.

For the past half-decade, I've learned how to lead hardware engineering projects with mechanical systems and electronic development. I see myself as understanding how to build and would like to play in the human engineering side - working with teams and understanding problem spaces, rather than only building on the engineering side.

I know that's broad: I want to help people solve problems with systems, automation, and teams. I'm job searching. If you think my background would be attractive to a group or person you know, I'd love to be in touch.

## The Next 3 Months

My current 'day job' is job searching.

**Personal Projects:**
- Spending time climbing at Mission Cliffs in the mornings
- Planning to run 100 miles in October while also not drinking that month
- Participating in Inktober (daily drawing challenge)
