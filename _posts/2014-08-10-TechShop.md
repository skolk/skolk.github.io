# TechShop Learning Journey: From CNC to Sheet Metal

TechShop was a revelation for me - a maker space with industrial-grade equipment that regular people could learn to use. Over several months, I took classes in CNC machining, sheet metal work, laser cutting, and 3D printing. It opened up a whole new world of making physical objects and understanding how things are actually manufactured.

## ShopBot CNC: Thinking in Wood

I took the CNC class to use the ShopBot, a large wood mill with a gantry of 8' x 4'! It's a class I'd been trying to get access to for quite a while since I wanted to move into making wooden furniture.

The teacher (also named Sean) took us through basic safety and then explained wood-specific milling concepts. Before this, I'd only worked with metal mills where we clamped all our material. Wood CNC uses a different approach - you have a scratch or sacrificial piece that you bolt down with copper screws and plastic brads.

After going over operations and making a quick tea light candle holder (admittedly pretty basic - all 5 students threw them away), we reviewed projects worth pursuing.

### Discovering Open Source Furniture

**Maker Table:** A version of AtFab's open-source furniture design with a full tutorial on making a customized table for your height and needs, from workbench to computer desk. I was really excited to make this in the future.

**AtFab:** Has a whole catalog of furniture they'll make for you, or you can download the plans and make it yourself. Most of it's quite pricey, so making it on the ShopBot seemed like the way to go.

**OpenDesk:** AtFab contributes to this platform where users can contribute designs and a community of over 100 different CNC mills can construct and ship for you.

**Open Source Bee Hives:** An example of projects with more than just furniture design in mind, aimed at distributing bee hives around the world.

The logistics challenge I anticipated was transport - CNC furniture projects would definitely be a car-centric activity.

## Sheet Metal: From Flat to Form

Learning sheet metal work was eye-opening. Last night's class taught me how to make a sheet metal box out of 16-gauge steel, and I used an impressive array of tools:

- **Automatic punch:** For creating precise holes
- **Hydraulic shear:** Clean, straight cuts through thick material
- **Turret punch:** Complex hole patterns and shapes
- **Straight shear:** Manual cutting for smaller pieces
- **Corner notcher:** Perfect 90-degree cuts for box corners
- **Finger brake:** Bending metal to precise angles
- **Hand-held riveter:** Assembly without welding

### The Design Process

SolidWorks has a sheet metal toolkit that I started experimenting with. The software helps you design parts that can actually be manufactured - understanding bend radii, material thickness, and how flat patterns translate to 3D forms.

Working with 22-gauge steel taught me that after cutting, thin metal is quite flimsy - good for bending but prone to dings if not handled correctly. This meant making another attempt the next day when I wasn't careful enough with the first piece.

## Water Jet Cutting: Precision in Steel

I learned to use the water jet at TechShop for my first trial project - making a holding case for a water filter process we used at work. Not the most artistic object, but one requiring high accuracy for riveted assembly.

The water jet was fascinating - using high-pressure water mixed with abrasive to cut through thick steel with incredible precision. The kerf (cut width) is tiny, allowing for very tight tolerances.

Working with thicker steel taught me about material properties - how different alloys cut differently, how heat affects the metal, and how to design parts that can actually be manufactured efficiently.

## Laser Cutting: From Digital to Physical

The laser cutter was my introduction to rapid prototyping. I made everything from simple brackets to complex assemblies, learning about:

**Kerf compensation:** Accounting for the width of the laser cut
**Material properties:** How different materials react to laser cutting
**Design for assembly:** Creating parts that fit together properly
**Iteration speed:** Being able to test and refine designs quickly

### Notable Projects

**Stars for awesome people:** I saw a post on Reddit where someone needed support, so I took their wording and did a simple cut. Sometimes making something physical for someone having a tough time can mean a lot.

**Plant holders:** I made air plant holders, experimenting with different materials and joint designs. Started with chipboard, then moved to birch when a friend asked for "one of those air plant holders."

**Herba Natantes redesign:** A friend asked for an air plant holder, and I couldn't bring myself to make it out of chipboard again, so I made it out of 1/8 inch birch. Then decided to make another one on the outside... then a lab worker suggested turning them into gears.

## The Learning Philosophy

What I loved about TechShop was the philosophy of learning by doing. Each class gave you just enough knowledge to be dangerous, then turned you loose to experiment. The real learning happened when you were trying to solve your own problems with the tools.

### Key Insights

**Tools amplify capability:** Having access to industrial equipment meant I could make things that would be impossible by hand.

**Design constraints teach creativity:** Each manufacturing process has limitations that force you to think differently about solutions.

**Community accelerates learning:** Other makers at TechShop were always willing to share knowledge and help troubleshoot problems.

**Iteration is everything:** Being able to quickly test and refine designs is more valuable than getting it perfect the first time.

## From Hobby to Hardware

The skills I learned at TechShop directly influenced my later work in hardware engineering:

**Understanding manufacturing:** Knowing how things are made helps you design better products
**Material selection:** Hands-on experience with different materials and processes
**Prototyping skills:** Ability to quickly make and test physical prototypes
**Design for manufacturing:** Thinking about how parts will actually be produced

## The Bigger Picture

TechShop represented something important - democratizing access to manufacturing tools. For a monthly membership, anyone could learn to use equipment that previously required years of apprenticeship or significant capital investment.

This connects to my broader interest in community building and education. Just like Adventure Report created a space for sharing stories, TechShop created a space for sharing knowledge about making things.

## Projects That Never Happened

Looking back, I planned many more projects than I completed:
- Custom furniture using the CNC
- Sheet metal cases for electronics projects  
- Complex laser-cut assemblies
- Integration between different manufacturing processes

But that's the nature of learning - the skills and knowledge gained were more valuable than any specific project. Understanding how things are made changed how I think about the physical world.

## The Closure

Unfortunately, TechShop eventually closed, which was a loss for the maker community. But the model lives on in other maker spaces around the world, and the skills learned continue to be valuable.

The experience taught me that having access to tools and instruction can unlock creativity in unexpected ways. Sometimes the limitation isn't your imagination - it's your ability to turn ideas into reality.

*Making things with your hands changes how you see the world. Every manufactured object becomes a puzzle to solve rather than magic to accept.*
