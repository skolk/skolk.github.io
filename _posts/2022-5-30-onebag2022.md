I like the idea of doing most of the travel things I want to do via a bag that fits under a seat. Even when I'm skiing, sailing, or climbing; I find that I like something similar to this setup for the majority of my traveling. There are a few things that change (rain jacket, hiking shoes/socks, leggings) if I'm in a colder or wetter place. I also find on many of those trips I'm brining a carry on bag, and the whole idea of one bagging is negated.

# Packing
### Flash 22:
I love this bag, it fits under my airplane seat. I can run with it, and it has enough pockets for water bottles, keys/quick needs, and my kindle/toiletries. I don't love zippers (they break), and when I have this over stuffed, I can fit my jacket on top with the buckle. This is my 3rd or 4th one over the past decade. They do wear out, but for how light they are I'm ok with that.

### Nylon spare bag:
I use this for groceries, or if I need to stash some things (my laptop or w.e) somewhere while I'm hiking or out for a quick trip but need to leave something behind and want to stay organized. I find it's quite useful, and weighs nothing.

# Tech:
### Macbook pro 14 inch:
I used to worry about my laptop battery, but whatever they updated in this version has the battery running for 8+ hours. I charge my phone off the laptop, and while it's heavier than my old Macbook pro 13 inch, the battery offset is worth it.

### Pixel 5a:
Battery lasts long enough for me not to worry as well, and I charge it off my laptop. I don't know why I like having an apple laptop and an android phone, but I do, and that's that. I use Google Fi, and haven't had any major problems white traveling.

### Kindle:
I find I don't read as much if I use my phone or an ipad. I tried the Ipad for a trip through the alps, and I did journal with it, but had a hard time reading and falling asleep. The Kindle is great to focus on.

### Bluetooth headphones:
I like the cord, I find I don't lose them. Battery lasts about 8 hours, which is great to travel and being on calls all day.

### Backup headphones:
I've had to use them before, I'd rather have them than not, especially when I forget to charge the others, and I'm on a flight.

### Paper/Pens:
I carry a few sheets of folded paper with me almost anywhere I go along with 2 micron pens. The pens are required for passport checks, the papers are just nice to sketch or be away from screens.


## Chargers:
### Apple 65W:
heavy, but it works

### USB - C cable 6ft:
I like the L connector for when I work from my lap

### 2x spare USB-C cable:
For charging my phone and headphones.

### USB-C to mini:
My headphones are usb-mini, and I have used these on other devices.



# Clothing:

## Footwear:
### Luna Falco:
I wear these almost all the time, I walk, hike, and run in them. They're supposed to be non-marking... I debate that, but they are still the most versatile footwear I've ever had. If it's cold I have these funny softshell shoes that came with them, but I've only had to wear those while it was snowing in Montana, and I had my parents send them to me.

### Prana Byron:
I've skied from Chamonix to Zermatt in these, I know the Stretch Zion is more suited to that, but these look nicer at dinner, and I can wear them to work events. Brown hides stains.

### Patagonia Nine Trails Shorts:
Patagonia running shorts with mesh. I swim in these too. I used to have a lighter weight pair. They have zippers so I'm not worried about dropping my phone while running or hiking.

### 2 light weight Nylon Shirts:
I think ones a 32Degrees and the other is an Vaori.

### REI Sahara long sleeve:
I like plaid shirts, and fly fishing shirts seems to work well

### Hat:
A hat from the place I lost my last hat: currently: San Juan, Washington.
People like to comment on islands, and there are lots of sailors there.

### Glasses:
Aviators from amazon.

### Underware:
Coolmax. I wear my shorts when running and they have a mesh liner, I wash these every once in a while, doesn't seem to be an issue.

### Arc Teryx Atom LT:
I had the Patagonia Nano Air hoody, and It was by far my favorite jacket. I wore it for probably 3, maybe 4 years, and it just got too compressed. I'm trying the Atom to see how it compares. If it's anything similar, then I can wear it up to 14,000 ft peaks, in high wind, and not feel too warm while at the airport (like I can in my down jackets). Also I find it cozy like cotton hoodies, and I don't find Down jackets to be.

### REI Flash Jacket:
Similar to the Hoodini, except it has pockets! I first wore my Patagonia Hoodini on my Haught Route trip, and found it incredible. It's the perfect mix of wearable in wind while active that would be too warm for the light puffy, and layers well over the puffy when it's raining. Not great for a downpour, but I would bring my gore-tex if this was a trip where I was going more remote.


# Other:

### Water bottle:
Hydro Flask Stainless Steel Coffee Travel Mug: I drink tea from this mug all day, it makes me happy. I carry it hiking, and if I need more water I bring a smart water bottle or something similar.

### Toiletries:
small plastic bag for contacts, tooth brush, and floss, and glasses



fears:
my macbook is too large/big and I'll never bring this setup hiking.
If I wanted to bring my mountaineering setup or anything else in life I would have to buy/find a few more things
and or bring my mountain shoes.

to do hard things, I usually need gear, this will test that assumption.

- could you pack a sleeping bag, mat, stove, and shelter in this?:
  ...maybe, but it would be tight, and food would be the real issue. If I dropped my laptop then yes, for sure.

items I'm considering :
hiking shoes la sportiva tx2
headlight
