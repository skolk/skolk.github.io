**Gear shot:** not everything is pictured, some of it I'm wearing :p, but that's most of what I'm carrying. 

**Overview:** I'm on a 2 month trip which will include: working from hotels/cafes/airbnbs (and maybe a client meeting in person), from the US, Kenya, and a few countries in Europe, attending a casual outdoor wedding in Kenya (might buy a shirt for that), hiking in the Pyrenees for 2-3 days, and sailing a day or two; This is what I started with, I'll update how the trip went when I get home. I write this after two weeks of travel; having already spent a week in Detroit for work and a layover in New York, and am currently in Nairobi.

**Packing thoughts:** I like the idea of having most things I travel with fit under a plane seat, which ends up being around 20L. Even when I'm skiing, sailing, or climbing; I find that I like something similar to this setup for the majority of my day to day. There are a few things that I change (rain jacket, hiking shoes/socks, leggings) if I'm in a colder or wetter place. I also find on many of those trips I'm brining a carry on bag, and the whole idea of one bagging is negated. That said, this is usually my cary on for those trips either way, so in a way it's my 'base' kit for day to day. 

# Packing

**REI Flash 22:** I love this bag, it fits under my airplane seat. I can run with it, and it has enough pockets for water bottles, keys/quick needs, and my kindle/toiletries. I don't love zippers (they break, get salty when at sea, or get mud/sand in them), and when I have this over stuffed, I can fit my jacket on top with the buckle. This is my 3rd or 4th Flash 22 over the past decade. They do wear out, but for how light they are I'm ok with that.

# Tech
**Macbook pro 14 inch:** I used to worry about my laptop battery, but whatever they updated in this version has the battery running for 8+ hours. I charge my phone off the laptop, and while it's heavier than my old Macbook pro 13 inch, the battery offset is worth it.

**Pixel 5a:** Battery lasts long enough for me not to worry as well, and I charge it off my laptop. I don't know why I like having an apple laptop and an android phone, but I do, and that's that. I use Google Fi, and haven't had any major problems while traveling.

**Kindle:** I find I don't read as much if I use my phone or an ipad. I tried the Ipad for a trip through the alps, and I did journal with it, but had a hard time reading and falling asleep. The Kindle is easy on the eyes while falling asleep, or reading for days in a tent while it's raining.

**Bluetooth headphones:** I like the cord, I find I don't lose them as I have with the pods. Battery lasts about 10 hours, which is great to travel and being on calls/music all day.

**Backup headphones:** I've had to use them before, I'd rather have them than not, especially when I forget to charge the others, and I'm on a flight, and there's a crying baby.

**Paper/Pens:** I carry a few sheets of folded paper with me almost anywhere I go along with 2 micron pens. I used to cary a moleskin journal, but didn't use it enough. The pens are required for passport checks, the papers are just nice to sketch or be away from screens.


##Chargers:
**Apple 65W:** heavy, but it works, I could get one of the lighter Anker ones.

**USB - C cable 6ft:** I like the L connector for when I work from my lap

**2x USB-C cables:** For charging my phone and headphones.

**USB-C to USB-mini converter:** My headphones are usb-mini, and I have used these on other devices. I might get USB-C to USB-A for the times I'm on a plane or rental car and there is only a USB-A connector.

# Clothing:
## Footware 
**Luna Falco:** I wear these almost all the time, I walk, hike, and run in them. They're supposed to be non-marking... I debate that, but they are still the most versatile footwear I've ever had. I get away without bringing socks, and I've worn them long enough that I don't feel my feat all the much... (this is.. good?). If it's really cold I have these funny softshell slippers with a toe wedge, but I've only had to wear those while it was snowing in Montana.

## Soft goods 
**Prana Byron:**I've skied from Chamonix to Zermatt in these, I know the Stretch Zion is more suited for that, but these look nicer at dinner, and I can wear them to work events. Brown hides stains.

**Patagonia Nine Trails Shorts:** Running shorts with mesh. I swim in these too. They have zippers so I'm not worried about dropping my phone while running or hiking. I workout in these in the morning and air them out in the evening.

**2 light weight Nylon Shirts:** I think ones a 32Degrees and the other is an Vaori. They don't smell too bad and I wash them maybe once a week, often while taking a shower. 

**REI Sahara long sleeve:** I like plaid shirts, and fly fishing shirts seems to work well as sun-shirts, and to take calls where I need a collar. 

**Hat:** A hat from the place I lost my last hat: currently: San Juan, Washington. People like to comment on islands, and there are lots of sailors there. It's been the start of more than one converstaion. I wonder where I'll lose it, and find the next one. 

**Glasses:** Aviators, nothing special.

**Underwear:** Coolmax. I wear my shorts when running and they have a mesh liner, I wash these every once in a while, doesn't seem to be an issue.

**REI Flash Jacket:** Similar to the Hoodini, except it has pockets! I first wore my Patagonia Hoodini on my Haught Route trip, and found it incredible. It's the perfect mix of wearable in wind while active that would be too warm for the light puffy, and layers well over the puffy when it's raining. Not great for a downpour, but I would bring my gore-tex if this was a trip where I was going more remote.

**Arc Teryx Atom LT:** I had the Patagonia Nano Air hoody, and It was by far my favorite jacket. I wore it for probably 3, maybe 4 years, and it just got too compressed. I'm trying the Atom to see how it compares. If it's anything similar, then I can wear it up to 14,000 ft peaks, in high wind, and not feel too warm while at the airport (like I can in my down jackets). Also I find it cozy like cotton hoodies, and I don't find down jackets to be. yes it's expensive, but it's basically the one jacket I know I can bring anywhere.

# Other:

**Water bottle:** Hydro Flask Stainless Steel Travel Mug: I drink tea from this mug all day, it makes me happy. I carry it hiking, and if I need more water I bring a smart water bottle or something similar.

**Dry Bag:** Nice to store phone/wallet in if I'm in the rain or kayaking or w/e. I've used it enough to keep it with me over the years.

**Toiletries:** Small plastic bag for contacts, tooth brush, and floss, and glasses. 

**Deodorant/Sunscreen:** Am human, do burn and smell.
