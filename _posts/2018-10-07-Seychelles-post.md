# Sailing Trip Report: Seychelles

**Location:** The Seychelles: Mahe, Praslin, Curious, La Digue, Silhouette  
**Time:** Sep-Oct 2018  
**Boat:** SunSail 444  
**Skipper:** Sean K.  
**Crew:** Kate S., Kate B., Emily W., Dave C., Gerald S., Joni N., Cami Z., Sarah G., Jane S.

## Overview

We flew from Nairobi to Mahe Victoria, less than a 3-hour flight. The Seychelles proved to be an incredible sailing destination with consistent SE winds, crystal clear waters, and some of the most beautiful anchorages I've ever experienced.

The SunSail 444 catamaran was well-suited for our crew of 10, though we quickly learned to manage our water consumption and adjust to the tropical sailing conditions.

## Highlights

**Wildlife:** We encountered dolphins, pilot whales, flying foxes, tropic birds, and even managed some diving with reef sharks and eagle rays.

**Anchorages:** From the protected coves of Praslin to the pristine beaches of La Digue, each stop offered something unique. The granite boulders and lush tropical vegetation made for spectacular scenery.

**Challenges:** A storm on day 4 tested our crew's resolve, but we learned valuable lessons about weather management and the importance of flexible planning.

## Key Lessons

- Anchoring in shallow tropical waters requires different techniques than temperate sailing
- Weather can change quickly - having backup plans is essential
- Managing water resources on a catamaran with 10 people requires discipline
- The journey matters as much as the destination

## Logistics

The trip cost approximately $1,400 per person for 10 days total, including boat charter, provisions, and local transportation. We found that renting cars was more economical than taxis for exploring the islands.

The Seychelles offers some of the world's most pristine sailing waters, but it's not a budget destination. The experience, however, was worth every penny - especially sharing it with a crew that became like family over the course of our adventure.
