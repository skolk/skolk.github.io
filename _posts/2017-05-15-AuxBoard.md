# AuxBoard: Designing Electronics for Biomedical Equipment

Working for a biomedical tech startup in San Francisco, I designed electronic sensors and actuators to control water flow, temperature, and direction with mechanical valves, multiple light inputs, and communications between systems. The project was originally scoped to be self-contained (on-off) with manual inputs (a flow knob and push buttons) and was scaled to be controlled by a computer terminal.

## The Challenge

The scope of this project was for the final year of the AUX board, which was a large shield for an Arduino Mega. We had discussions several times about using industrial-grade PLCs or if the Arduino was suitable for the job (compared to a BeagleBone or Raspberry Pi), but due to its reliability, ease of use, and cost, the company decided to continue using the Arduino.

The board needed to manage:
- **Water flow control:** Precise flow rates for tissue processing
- **Temperature regulation:** Maintaining optimal conditions for biological samples
- **Valve control:** Multiple solenoid valves for fluid routing
- **Sensor integration:** pH, temperature, flow rate, and pressure monitoring
- **Communication:** Serial communication with the main computer system
- **Safety systems:** Emergency shutoffs and alarm conditions

## Design Evolution

The initial layout was designed in Eagle, then redesigned in DipTrace, and finally in Altium (part of this was due to company funding changes over the project timeline).

The first iterations were hand-populated, while later revisions used PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly). This transition taught me valuable lessons about scaling from prototype to production.

## Technical Specifications

**Voltages:** The board handled 3.3V, 5V, 24V, and isolated analog signals
**Communication:** Multiple serial interfaces and I2C buses
**I/O:** Over 40 digital and analog I/O pins
**Power management:** Multiple isolated power domains
**Safety features:** Watchdog timers and failsafe circuits

## Key Technical Learnings

### Test Before Scaling
This seems obvious, but when working with parts that are too small to test specific IOs (like BGAs), use a different package before ordering a populated version of a board that could have untestable traces. I had issues jumping too quickly into PCBAs when I would have learned more about my components by populating them myself.

### Component Consistency
I had issues with capacitors that weren't identical and had different tolerances. Seemingly small differences in component specifications can cause major system issues.

### Test Points Everywhere
For almost any part of the board, having a test point or jumper connection is extremely helpful in troubleshooting. The two most obvious places NOT to do this are on antennas and between a clock and the IC.

### Star Point Grounding
Star points are crucial for boards with multiple voltages. The star point is where all grounds should meet and overlay so there isn't ground variance. With 3.3V, 5V, 24V, and isolated analog signals on the same board, organizing the layout so the star point was relevant for all voltages was a major design consideration.

### Analog/Digital Isolation
Analog and digital signals must be isolated from each other, including their grounds. This was especially critical for the precision measurements required in biomedical applications.

## Manufacturing Challenges

### Connector Selection
I spent considerable time with the Molex micro connector catalog. There are lots of little bumps and features for these connectors, and I learned to design custom footprints and construct test cables for validation.

### LED Verification
LEDs are cheap and easy to place. If cost isn't a huge factor (as with industrial machines versus consumer electronics), place them everywhere: power indicators, IC status, resets, and basically any I/O. This saved countless debugging hours.

### Factory Communication
If a factory tells you they're moving but your order shouldn't be affected, don't believe them. Always have backup plans for critical components and timelines.

## Biomedical Requirements

Working in the biomedical space taught me about requirements that don't exist in consumer electronics:

**Reliability:** Systems need to work consistently for months without intervention
**Traceability:** Every component and process needs documentation for regulatory compliance
**Safety:** Failure modes must be predictable and safe
**Precision:** Measurements need to be accurate and repeatable
**Contamination control:** Electronics must not introduce contaminants into biological systems

## From Arduino to Production

One of the most interesting aspects was proving that Arduino-based systems could work in precision biomedical applications. The key was understanding that:

**Reliability comes from design, not platform:** A well-designed Arduino system can be more reliable than a poorly designed industrial controller

**Cost matters:** Arduino shields cost a fraction of custom embedded systems while providing similar functionality

**Iteration speed:** Arduino's ecosystem allowed rapid prototyping and testing

**Community support:** The vast Arduino community provided solutions to common problems

## System Integration

The AuxBoard didn't work in isolation - it was part of a larger automated system that included:
- **Imaging systems:** High-resolution cameras and lighting
- **Mechanical systems:** Precision slicing and sample handling
- **Software control:** Computer vision and automated decision-making
- **User interface:** Operator control and monitoring systems

Managing the integration between these systems taught me about:
- **Communication protocols:** Ensuring reliable data exchange
- **Timing coordination:** Synchronizing multiple subsystems
- **Error handling:** Graceful degradation when components fail
- **User feedback:** Providing operators with clear system status

## Impact and Lessons

The AuxBoard project taught me that:

**Good engineering is platform-agnostic:** The principles of reliable design apply whether you're using Arduino or industrial PLCs

**Documentation is crucial:** Especially when working with external manufacturers and regulatory requirements

**Testing is everything:** Every design decision should be validated at the component, board, and system level

**Iteration matters:** Moving from hand-populated prototypes to PCBA taught lessons that couldn't be learned any other way

This project bridged the gap between maker-space prototyping and industrial biomedical equipment, proving that with careful design and thorough testing, accessible platforms like Arduino can power sophisticated scientific instruments.

*Sometimes the best solution isn't the most expensive or complex - it's the one that reliably solves the problem at hand.*
