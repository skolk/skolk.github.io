# Progression and Feedback as a Lone Traveling Pilot

## Finding a Mentor

While paragliding in the French Alps in 2018, I ran into a British pilot who befriended me and took me under his wing while we camped in the same site outside Annecy in the paragliding capital of France, Doussard. I had just achieved P2 novice pilot ranking and was touring Europe, getting in over my head flying cross-country with guided groups - what almost every pilot I met said was "too little experience."

Dominic didn't critique my actions. Instead, he asked what was the logic behind my decisions: "What precautions have you taken for this scenario?" He was less interested in hard rules and more interested in the whys rather than the whats.

This is difficult in paragliding since, unlike many other outdoor activities, you really can have fatal mistakes. Almost everyone knows someone who's no longer with us. This leads to stark reactions to those not following norms and protective behavior around launch sites.

## The Active Listening Technique

Dominic was a retired consultant who employed a technique called "Active listening." It was almost as if he handled every encounter with "soft hands." He would ask how and why several times before ever stating a fact, setting the stage so anyone could give input and informing them that once they had accomplished that, they had the choice in how to proceed.

In one instance, a French pilot expressed concern over my wing, saying it was too advanced for my experience. Dominic asked why he was concerned. The pilot responded that he would feel bad if I was injured and he hadn't said anything. Dominic pointed out that he had now said something, I was aware and had thanked him, and it was now up to me to make my choices.

## The Philosophy of Progression

Dominic told me about his consulting work and the motorcycle training company he'd founded. His core belief: if you weren't progressing, you were regressing. The best way to continue improving was to keep stepping up the ladder and checking off skills, even if you don't think they're immediately relevant.

We talked about guided experiences - how taking your comfort zone further with guides allows you to normalize risk that you can undertake later without their aid.

## Putting It Into Practice

This was solidified when I traveled to the Swiss Alps with friends practicing acro-paragliding. They gave me the opportunity to practice collapses, spirals, surges, and partial stalls - maneuvers I was always hesitant to do without a lake or quick ride back to launch. I even did my first tandem flight where my friend took me far beyond my comfort level while showing me what to expect and prepare for.

## Key Lessons

**Experience different teaching styles:** By encountering various personalities and environments, I explored different tools and lessons that expanded my understanding.

**Active listening works:** Setting the stage for input while maintaining personal agency creates better learning environments.

**Guided experiences expand comfort zones:** Professional instruction allows you to safely experience situations you couldn't access on your own.

**Progression requires intention:** You have to actively seek out new challenges and skills, not just accumulate hours doing the same thing.

**Community matters:** The paragliding community's protective nature, while sometimes frustrating, exists for good reasons. Learning to navigate social dynamics is part of the sport.

The balance between safety and progression in high-risk activities requires careful calibration. Too conservative and you don't grow; too aggressive and you don't survive to apply what you've learned. Finding mentors who can help you navigate that balance makes all the difference.
