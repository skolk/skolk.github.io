# One Step a Day: A Goal Setting System That Actually Works

## How I Came to Think About Goal Setting

The first time I realized I could plot a course for life was 2007. I was working in a used camping gear shop just off Georgia Tech's campus in Atlanta, where I had opened an Outside Magazine and was reading a story on 10 people who were "living their dream life."

One story that caught me was about a director of the IRC (International Rescue Committee) who spent his time flying all over the world from earthquakes to floods to civil wars, helping people get where they needed to go.

I looked up what it took to get to his position: must be fluent in French, drive stick shift, and have lived in a third world country for at least 5 years. I signed up for French class, asked my roommate to teach me stick shift, and applied to a student group with opportunities in Nairobi.

## The System

One year later, in a cafe in Nairobi, confused and frustrated but having learned an incredible amount, a friend introduced me to a model from Zig Ziglar: **Be, Do, Have**.

Define what you want to be, what you want to do, what you'd like to have. Then work backwards.

### The Process

1. **Start at the end** - What do you want to have been, have done, and had by... the end?
2. **Work backwards** - 10 years, 5 years, 1 year, then quarterly
3. **Make it concrete** - Break the year into 4 quarters
4. **Create accountability** - Systems that help you succeed even when you fail
5. **Plan like you need it** - Put it on paper, tell those who matter

### The Quarterly Calendar

I focus on the Equinox and Solstice for planning. Each quarter I:
- Review what I want in 10 years (the direction)
- Plan what I want in 1 year (the target)
- Break it into quarterly goals (the steps)
- Create weekly actions (the movement)

Sometimes goals are big (saving to buy a car), sometimes seasonal (go skiing, see wildflower bloom). The result is a year-out calendar that gets reviewed every quarter.

## The Hard Part: Accountability

It's not hard to say "I'm going to sail around the world" and then not do it. It's much harder when you give a friend $5000 and say "If I don't have a boat by next year, keep this."

Examples of accountability systems:
- Financial stakes with friends
- Public commitments with deadlines
- Joining groups with shared goals
- Setting up automatic consequences

I know when I plan a trip that when I set a date and pay someone, I'm going to do it. That's why marathons with entry fees work better than "I'll just run my own marathon."

## Key Principles

**Systems over goals:** Create systems that let you succeed even when you fail.

**Quantity over quality leads to quality:** Draw 20 pictures to get your 3 masterpieces.

**One thing at a time:** Accept that you can only do one thing at a time, but commit to a few of them.

**Values-based:** Connect goals to your values - I am helpful therefore I want to help X number of people.

## The Results

This system has helped me:
- Learn to sail and organize sailing expeditions around the world
- Co-found a company that's still operating in Kenya
- Build a tiny house from a shipping container
- Climb mountains on multiple continents
- Start community events that have run for years

The circle concept: I think of the calendar as a circle, with New Year at the bottom and Spring/Summer at the top, like a clock. This helps visualize how much time each goal takes and how they flow into each other.

*Plan like you need it. Make a lot of plans. Accept that you can only do one thing at a time. Commit to a few of them. Turn it into a system. Set a due date. Create accountability. Get excited about it. Put it on paper. Tell those who matter. One step a day.*
