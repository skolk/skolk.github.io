# Building the Halfway House: A Shipping Container Tiny House

The Halfway House was built in a West Oakland 'Tiny House' construction warehouse. There were around 14 other houses being built in the space - ours was just one of them. We shared tools, knowledge, and resources. Some were all wood, some were on trailers, most, like ours, were shipping container buildouts.

## The Challenge

This was our first house build, and our original location was outside in the SF rainy season. We hesitated for at least a month on window dimensions, location, and sourcing. In the end we opted to cut a wall out (really, rather than make the window decision).

We were sleeping in a tent outside the container for at least a month, and on top of the container for maybe a week or so. Many of our neighbors had tents or easy-ups with tarps around them in a similar fashion.

## Key Learnings

**Shipping containers aren't always ideal:** While I'm glad we used one originally, once we realized we weren't going to stack anything on it and could build inside, we basically built out what could have been a cheaper and more breathable wood house.

**The right tools matter:** A drywall mounter was the best tool I bought - it turns 2-person jobs into 1-person jobs. Kate loves it for that reason too.

**Side entry vs. container doors:** We chose French doors over the shipping container doors because side entry made the whole space feel less like a hallway. The corners are where lots of space can be filled with 'working spaces' like bathrooms and kitchen prep areas.

## The Build Process

**Windows and doors:** We found windows and French doors we liked after much deliberation. The French doors made the center area well-lit and very open when we cleared all the construction materials.

**Kitchen:** The close side was redwood from a mill (no idea how we got that for free), the other side was strips of cedar I glued and pressed together. We later added a drop-in stove and finished the window lining.

**Sleeping area:** A raised bed allowed for much-needed storage space. We separated the two areas and placed a cabinet below facing toward the living area.

**Table:** We built a drop-down table with swinging legs that functioned as both a bench for dinner and a guest bed, which it did several times.

## The Mistakes

**Building on the build:** I built a tiny house on the tiny house while in the middle of construction between the sprinkler water lines! Had to remove it carefully due to fire inspection and logic. I did rent it out to a friend though - was a great 4 months.

**Living in your construction project:** Turns out this is a bad idea. Getting doors, windows, and a bed in became a priority when you're trying to live there.

## The Outcome

We ended up selling the Halfway House for about what we paid to build it (minus labor) at $8,000. It was a great build project, and we met lots of great friends along the way.

## Reflections

I don't recommend the shipping container part, but building a house is absolutely a learning experience in:
- How much living spaces cost
- Space, sound, and lighting design
- Understanding how water and electrical systems work
- Appreciation for all the finishing work in any house

The warehouse community was incredible - sharing tools, knowledge, and the journey with other builders made the whole experience worthwhile. Sometimes the process teaches you as much as the final product.

*The final colors reminded me of chocolate and peanut butter. We also built a deck on top where Kate sewed and we had extra storage.*
