# The Nairobi Lamp: Teaching Making in Kenya

Made from a tin can, local wood, and molded cement, the Nairobi Lamp was an experiment in teaching. I arrived in Kenya with the knowledge that Kenyans are entrepreneurial people - almost everyone has a side hustle - and that I had access to markets that many craftspeople didn't.

So I set about to make a product that could be replicated from local materials, teach new usable skills, and solve a need I and others had.

## The Concept

The idea was simple but comprehensive:
- **Use only local materials:** Tin cans, Kenyan hardwood, cement, local electrical parts
- **Require only hand tools:** No expensive equipment needed
- **Teach transferable skills:** Wire stripping, basic electrical work, molding
- **Create market access:** Connect makers with customers who appreciated handmade goods
- **Solve real problems:** Provide quality lighting while generating income

## The Design Process

**Materials:**
- Recycled tin cans (abundant and free)
- Local hardwood scraps (from furniture makers)
- Cement (readily available and cheap)
- Basic electrical components (switches, wire, bulbs)

**Tools needed:**
- Hand saw
- Wire strippers
- Basic hand tools for woodworking
- Simple molds for cement work

**Skills taught:**
- Safe electrical wiring
- Basic woodworking and finishing
- Cement molding and finishing
- Quality control and consistency
- Basic business skills (pricing, customer service)

## The Teaching Experiment

Using only hand tools and locally sourced electric parts, I began making the lamp. After some traction (people asking "can I buy one of those?"), I began teaching my neighborhood gate guard to strip wires and assemble housings.

This became a real test of whether the design was truly replicable:
- **Could someone else learn it quickly?**
- **Were the skills transferable to other projects?**
- **Could quality be maintained across different makers?**
- **Was there genuine market demand?**

## The Learning Process

**For the student:**
- New technical skills (electrical wiring, finishing techniques)
- Quality standards and consistency
- Customer interaction and feedback
- Basic business operations

**For me:**
- How to break down complex tasks into teachable steps
- Communication across language barriers
- Understanding local material availability and costs
- Appreciation for existing skills and knowledge in the community

## Economic Philosophy

This project was based on several beliefs about development and entrepreneurship:

**Local materials matter:** Using resources available in the community keeps money local and reduces dependency on imports.

**Skills transfer better than aid:** Teaching someone to make something creates lasting capability rather than temporary relief.

**Market access is often the real barrier:** Many people have skills but lack connections to customers who value their work.

**Small-scale manufacturing can work:** Not everything needs to be mass-produced in factories to be economically viable.

## The Challenges

**Quality consistency:** Hand-made products vary, which some customers love and others don't.

**Scaling production:** Training multiple people while maintaining quality standards is complex.

**Material supply:** Even "local" materials can have supply chain issues.

**Market education:** Customers needed to understand the value proposition of handmade goods.

**Competition:** Machine-made alternatives were often cheaper, requiring emphasis on quality and uniqueness.

## Community Response

The project generated interest beyond just the lamp itself:

**Skills sharing:** People wanted to learn the electrical and finishing techniques for other projects.

**Material sourcing:** Connections developed for finding good wood scraps and electrical components.

**Market networks:** Word spread about custom lamp makers, leading to other opportunities.

**Inspiration for other projects:** The model encouraged other experiments in local manufacturing.

## Lessons About Teaching

**Start with motivation:** People learn faster when they understand how skills will benefit them.

**Use familiar materials:** Building on existing knowledge accelerates learning.

**Emphasize safety:** Electrical work requires careful attention to safety protocols.

**Allow for creativity:** The best students modified the design to suit their own aesthetic and market understanding.

**Document everything:** Having clear, visual instructions helps with quality control and training new people.

## Broader Implications

This experience influenced my thinking about:

**Technology transfer:** How knowledge moves between communities and contexts

**Appropriate scale:** When small-scale, local production makes more sense than mass manufacturing

**Education models:** Learning through making versus classroom instruction

**Economic development:** Bottom-up versus top-down approaches to creating opportunities

**Design thinking:** How constraints lead to creative solutions

## The Business Model

**Low barriers to entry:** Minimal startup costs and equipment requirements

**Flexible production:** Could be done part-time alongside other work

**Direct market feedback:** Close customer relationships provided immediate quality feedback

**Skill building:** Each lamp taught skills applicable to other electrical and crafting projects

**Community integration:** Used existing social and economic networks

## Shipping and Scaling

Shipping outside Kenya was possible but required critical mass (about 10 orders) to make economic sense, at around $20 USD per lamp. This highlighted the importance of local markets and the challenges of competing globally with handmade products.

The real value wasn't in shipping lamps around the world but in demonstrating that local manufacturing could create meaningful opportunities using available resources and skills.

## Long-term Impact

While I moved on to other projects, the skills and connections created through the Nairobi Lamp project continued:

**The gate guard** went on to do electrical work for other projects in the neighborhood

**Material networks** continued to benefit other makers

**The model** was adapted for other products by different people

**Relationships** built during the project led to other opportunities

## Reflection on Development

This project taught me that effective development work is less about bringing solutions from outside and more about:

- **Amplifying existing capabilities:** People already had many relevant skills
- **Providing market access:** Connecting makers with customers who valued their work  
- **Teaching complementary skills:** Adding electrical knowledge to existing crafting abilities
- **Building on local materials:** Using what's available rather than importing solutions

The Nairobi Lamp wasn't revolutionary technology - it was appropriate technology that connected local materials, existing skills, new techniques, and market opportunities in a way that created value for everyone involved.

*The best teaching happens when both teacher and student learn something new, and when the skills taught can be applied far beyond the original project.*
