# Sanivation: Building a Social Enterprise

In 2012, Andrew, Emily, Chris, Nick and I worked together to form a company focused on solar ovens as a means of heating and dehydrating human waste to render it inert. We were accepted into the incubator program Start-Up Chile in Santiago for 6 months.

## The Problem

Sanitation is a massive global challenge, particularly in equatorial regions and developing countries. Traditional sewage systems are expensive to build and maintain, leaving millions without access to safe waste management.

## Our Solution

We developed solar ovens that could process human waste safely and efficiently. The concept was elegant: use abundant solar energy to heat waste to temperatures that kill pathogens, creating a safe disposal method that doesn't require extensive infrastructure.

## The Journey

During our time in Chile, we:

- Researched the water and sanitation sector across different regions
- Visited refugee housing and slums called "campamentos" 
- Worked with Un Techo para Chile to build test units
- Developed operational procedures and best practices
- Tested pathogen elimination at various temperature and humidity levels
- Prototyped solar oven and container designs

## Key Learnings

**Business Model:** We learned that technology alone isn't enough - you need sustainable business models that work within local economic realities.

**User Research:** Spending time in communities taught us that successful solutions must fit into existing social and cultural practices.

**Partnerships:** Working with established NGOs like Un Techo provided crucial local knowledge and credibility.

**Technical Validation:** Our testing showed that solar heating could effectively eliminate pathogens, but implementation required careful attention to local climate conditions.

## The Outcome

While my involvement ended after the Chile program, the company continued operations in Naivasha, Kenya, where it now serves over 250+ households and functions as a self-sustaining business with goals to expand across East Africa.

## Reflections

Sanivation taught me that creating sustainable impact requires:

1. **Deep user research** - Understanding real needs, not assumed needs
2. **Local partnerships** - Working with communities, not for them  
3. **Business model innovation** - Finding ways to make social good economically sustainable
4. **Technical humility** - Simple, robust solutions often work better than complex ones

This experience shaped my approach to all future projects - whether it's organizing sailing expeditions or building hardware companies, the same principles apply: understand your users, build partnerships, and create systems that can sustain themselves.

*Sanivation continues to operate in Kenya today, proving that well-designed social enterprises can create lasting impact while remaining financially sustainable.*
