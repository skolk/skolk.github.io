I've been organizing sailing expeditions since 2012, proving that you don't need to own a boat to have incredible adventures on the water. Through Boatless Sailing, I've led charters around the world for 40+ people who share a passion for exploration and the sea.

## Philosophy

**Charter over ownership** — Sailing other people's boats gives you access to better vessels, more destinations, and shared expertise without the maintenance burden.

**Community building** — The intensity of sailing creates lasting bonds. Being dependent on each other, facing challenges together, exploring beautiful places together—this builds relationships that extend far beyond the water.

**Skills development** — Each expedition teaches navigation, boat handling, cultural immersion, team dynamics, and self-reliance when you're far from shore.

**Embrace challenges** — Things will go wrong. That's where the best stories come from. Whether it's a failed freshwater impeller in the Sea of Cortez or hove-to in a storm, adversity reveals character and builds capability.

## The Learning Curve

Sailing integrates diverse skills: planning, boat systems, logistics, coordination, cooking, medical response, wildlife identification, and interpersonal communication. Figuring out why everyone is on the trip is crucial for ensuring everyone feels safe and heard.

We use nightly crew reviews, one-on-one check-ins, and role changes for situations that aren't working. Little things become big things when you literally have nowhere else to go. The elephants in the room must be addressed.

Due to this intensity, friendships form and sometimes issues that have been underwater for a long time surface and get resolved.

## Boatless Sailing Community

Nearly 40 people have joined charter expeditions over the years. Many have sailed multiple trips and formed lasting friendships. Some have gone on to racing, others to cruising, many to acquiring new skills beyond sailing.

We typically organize a trip every six months, and destinations keep getting more remote. The community continues to grow, united by the belief that the best adventures happen when you're slightly out of your comfort zone, surrounded by people you trust.
