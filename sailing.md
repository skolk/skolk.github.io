# Sailing

I've been organizing sailing expeditions since 2012, proving that you don't need to own a boat to have incredible adventures on the water. Through Boatless Sailing, I've led charters around the world for 40+ people who share a passion for exploration and the sea.

## Recent Expeditions

**The Seychelles (2018)** — 10-day expedition through pristine granite islands with a crew of 10. Encountered dolphins, whale sharks, and some of the world's most beautiful anchorages. Storm challenges taught us about weather management and flexible planning.

**Croatia (2018)** — 7-day exploration of the Dalmatian coast during World Cup finals and Ultra music festival. Mediterranean mooring, crowded anchorages, and complex navigation through hundreds of Croatian islands.

**Dar es Salaam to Tanga Race (2019)** — 250-mile coastal race in Tanzania without an engine. Pure sailing from start to finish, learning about wind patterns, current management, and the essence of what sailing actually is.

## Philosophy

**Charter over ownership** — Sailing other people's boats gives you access to better vessels, more destinations, and shared expertise without the hassles of maintenance and storage.

**Community building** — The intensity of sailing creates bonds that last far beyond the trip. Being dependent on each other, facing challenges together, exploring beautiful places together.

**Skills development** — Each expedition teaches navigation, boat handling, cultural immersion, team dynamics, and self-reliance when you're far from shore.

## Destinations Sailed

- **San Francisco Bay** — Home waters, learning ground
- **Sacramento River Delta** — Weekend escapes and skill building
- **La Paz, Baja Sur Mexico** — Incredible wildlife, warm water, friendly locals
- **Bay of Phuket, Thailand** — Limestone karsts, clear water, cultural immersion
- **Catalina Island, California** — Classic Southern California sailing
- **Split, Croatia** — Mediterranean sailing through the Dalmatian islands
- **The Seychelles** — Pristine waters and incredible wildlife
- **Dar es Salaam to Tanga, Tanzania** — East African coast racing
- **The Dodecanese, Greece** — Ancient history and reliable winds

## What Makes It Work

**Careful crew selection** — Sailing compatibility matters more than friendship compatibility. Mixed experience levels, shared commitment to learning and safety.

**Thorough planning** — Research destinations, weather patterns, local customs. Plan for challenges because things will go wrong, and that's where the best stories come from.

**Focus on experience** — The goal isn't to cover maximum distance but to have meaningful adventures. Sometimes the best sailing happens when you're hove-to in a storm, learning about your crew and yourself.

**Skills sharing** — Teaching and learning happen simultaneously. Experienced sailors mentor newcomers, everyone contributes their unique perspectives and capabilities.

## The Learning Curve

Sailing brings lots of different skills together: planning, boat knowledge, logistics, coordination, cooking, medical response, wildlife identification, and interpersonal communication. Figuring out why everyone is on the trip is crucial for ensuring everyone feels safe and heard.

We use nightly crew reviews, one-on-one check-ups, and role changes for situations that aren't working. Little things become big things when you literally have nowhere else to go. The elephants in the room have to be addressed.

Due to this intensity, friendships form and sometimes issues that have been underwater for a long time get brought up and resolved.

## Current Projects

**A Path into Sailing** — Writing a comprehensive guide for people interested in getting into sailing, covering everything from basic skills to organizing your own charter expeditions.

**Next Expeditions** — Always planning the next adventure. Recent focus on more remote destinations and longer passages. The boats are getting bigger, the crews more experienced, and the adventures more ambitious.

**Boatless Sailing Community** — Nearly 40 people in our charter sailing group. Many members have sailed multiple trips and formed lasting friendships. Some have gone on to racing, others to fishing and cooking, many to acquiring new skills beyond sailing.

## Getting Involved

If you're interested in charter sailing:

- **Start local** — Learn basic sailing skills in familiar waters before going international
- **Choose crew carefully** — Shared commitment to learning and safety matters most
- **Embrace challenges** — Things will go wrong, and that's often where the best stories come from
- **Focus on connection** — The water is always calling, and there's room for sailors ready for adventure

*We seem to have a trip every six months or so, and the locations keep getting more remote. The community continues to grow, united by the belief that the best adventures happen when you're slightly out of your comfort zone, surrounded by people you trust.*
