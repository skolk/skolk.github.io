Mt Baker



Friday we drove out from Kates parents house to glacier around 3pm to the base of mt baker. WIth little traffic we arrived up the Kenya like rode (lots of potholes) after about 3 hours, to a decent amount of rain that we wern’t expecting. There’s no cell signal up there, and we looked at each other a bit worried. We could hike in rain like this, but it wouldn’t be fun by any means. A few minuet later Tristen showed up, and the rain began to die down; We packed our gear and explained a plan; since the weather was rolling in, we’d hike in tonight 2-3 miles 2000+ft (600m) up to hogsback camp, camp for the night, and alpine start as early as made sense.

Kate and I went up in our trail shoes with boots on back, which I’m grateful for, crossing two streams  and plenty of wooded trail, the last 800ft(250m) was soft snow and then we were in at camp. I found our friends we knew would be up there, and we set up camp nearby a stream, ate dinner, and crashed; planning to wake up at 3:15am to be ready by 4ish. 



We slept warm, and woke to a decent sky, the mountain was covered, but that could be possible all day, we rounded up all our gear, made hot drinks, and roped up. There were probably 3-4 teams we could see heading out.  The snow was icy freeze thaw, so we put crampons and helmets on, and set out for the roman wall, puffys, rope, headlight. Tristan didn’t have any glacier experience so he was in the middle, kate being lighter, took the lead and I had the picket in the rear. 

The sun came up over the ridge at around 5am, but with the fog and cloud cover, it was hazy at best, we made it up to the base of the Roman wall through ice fall and cravasses in two hours. One soloist had submitted at dawn, and said it was windy, and the clouds were spotty, he saw the horizon for ten minuets before it was covered, then headed back down. 



The mix of hiking 1000ft(300m) up hill with wind and glaciers makes a difficult mix of sweaty and cold. We were all changing layers and adjusting for the entier trip. We probably took a break for food once an hour, and didn’t refill water the whole trip; Kate and I usually only carry 1Liter, and a stove, but didn’t refill this time. 

One of the difficult parts of being on a rope team is the required spacing. Because Cravasses (or falls in general) can happen unexpectedly, the point of a rope team is to prevent a fatal mishap by every climber acting as an anchor, this means keeping your self at distence to prevent shockloads, and reduce acceleration. Because you’re moving you have to keep at similar paces, even if you’r eon different terrain. When the lead begins to climb a steeper route, the mid and tailes need to slow down, and the lead has to low when their on a flat, and the tail is still climbing. It makes for a generally slower overall pace, but a safer one; so While we might have only covered five miles overland, on glacier doing vertical is easier to track, and even then I’d plan on being 20% slower. 



We reached the falst summit (pleateau) at 10,500 or so feet by 9am; it had taken up around 5 hours to climb 5,000ft (1,600m). I’d say there were easily 5 parties coming down as we were going up the crest, yet we had the summit to ourselves. Pictures were taken, Really just us, the clouds, and the sun; only one unidentifliabel peak in the distance, everything else below cloudline. 



We slowly made our way back in almost the same time (13:00 to camp), and then 15:00 to car. We drove back to Langley to rest and recover for the remainder of the weekend.
