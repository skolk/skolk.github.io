          <h1 id="making">Making</h1>

<p>I believe in learning through building. Whether it’s brain-slicing robots for biotech research, electronics for precision control systems, or tiny houses from shipping containers, making things teaches you how the world actually works.</p>

<h2 id="major-projects">Major Projects</h2>

<p><strong>Brain Slicing Robots at 3Scan (2013-2018)</strong> — First employee at a biotech startup building automated digital pathology systems. Designed liquid handling systems, PCB layouts, and manufacturing processes that scaled from Arduino prototypes to production biomedical equipment.</p>

<p><strong>AuxBoard Electronics (2017)</strong> — Designed Arduino-based control systems for biomedical equipment, managing water flow, temperature, and communications. Proved that accessible platforms like Arduino could power sophisticated scientific instruments with proper engineering.</p>

<p><strong>The Halfway House (2016)</strong> — Built a tiny house from a shipping container in a West Oakland warehouse with 14 other builders. Learned about space design, electrical systems, water management, and the reality that living in your construction project is a terrible idea.</p>

<p><strong>Nairobi Lamp (2011)</strong> — Created locally-manufacturable lamps in Kenya using tin cans, hardwood, and cement. Taught electrical wiring and assembly skills as sustainable income opportunities, demonstrating appropriate technology principles.</p>

<h2 id="learning-spaces">Learning Spaces</h2>

<p><strong>TechShop</strong> — Learned CNC machining, sheet metal fabrication, laser cutting, and water jet cutting. Access to industrial equipment democratized manufacturing and taught design for production principles.</p>

<p><strong>Corrugated Underground</strong> — Tiny house building community in West Oakland. Shared tools, knowledge, and resources while learning construction skills and alternative living approaches.</p>

<p><strong>3Scan Engineering</strong> — Biotech hardware development from prototype to production. Learned about regulatory requirements, manufacturing scaling, and precision engineering for scientific applications.</p>

<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

<p><strong>Constraints drive creativity</strong> — Limitations often lead to better solutions. Whether it’s building with only local materials in Kenya or fitting everything into a shipping container, constraints force innovative thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Learn by failing</strong> — The best education comes from projects that don’t work the first time. Failed attempts teach more about materials, processes, and problem-solving than successful ones.</p>

<p><strong>Document everything</strong> — Taking photos, writing notes, and sharing failures helps you remember lessons and contributes to community knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Start with available tools</strong> — Begin with what you have access to rather than waiting for perfect equipment. Arduino shields proved adequate for biomedical applications; shipping containers worked for housing experiments.</p>

<h2 id="technical-skills-developed">Technical Skills Developed</h2>

<p><strong>Electronics Design</strong> — PCB layout, component selection, signal integrity, power management, manufacturing preparation. Experience with everything from prototyping to regulatory compliance.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanical Systems</strong> — Precision machining, sheet metal fabrication, assembly processes, manufacturing constraints. Understanding how digital designs become physical objects.</p>

<p><strong>Software Integration</strong> — Embedded systems, automation, data collection, user interfaces. Bridging hardware and software for complete system solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Manufacturing Processes</strong> — Design for manufacturing, quality control, scaling from prototypes to production, working with contract manufacturers.</p>

<h2 id="current-making">Current Making</h2>

<p><strong>Ocean Technology Development</strong> — Through Astraeus Ocean Systems, developing marine monitoring and sustainable infrastructure systems. Applying years of hardware experience to environmental challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Climate Technology</strong> — Supporting bio-regenerative programs at REAP Climate Center, understanding how technology can address environmental problems at scale.</p>

<p><strong>Tools and Planning Systems</strong> — Building calendar and trip planning applications that help people organize complex projects and adventures.</p>

<h2 id="making-community">Making Community</h2>

<p><strong>Skill Sharing</strong> — Teaching electronics, fabrication, and project planning to others. The best way to learn something thoroughly is to teach it.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source Principles</strong> — Sharing designs, documenting processes, contributing to community knowledge. Making is more powerful when knowledge flows freely.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Disciplinary Learning</strong> — The most interesting projects happen at intersections: biotech + electronics, sailing + community building, climate technology + business development.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>

<p><strong>Local Materials First</strong> — Using available resources reduces costs, supports local economies, and often leads to more creative solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong> — Quick iteration cycles help test assumptions and refine designs. Better to build ten rough prototypes than spend months on one perfect design.</p>

<p><strong>User-Centered Design</strong> — Understanding who will use what you’re building and how it fits into their workflows and constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Systems Thinking</strong> — Individual components matter less than how they work together as complete solutions.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-making">Lessons from Making</h2>

<p><strong>Everything is more complex than it appears</strong> — Simple objects involve sophisticated manufacturing, supply chains, and engineering decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Quality comes from process</strong> — Consistent results require repeatable processes, clear documentation, and systematic quality control.</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration amplifies capability</strong> — The best projects happen when different skills and perspectives combine around shared goals.</p>

<p><strong>Making changes how you see the world</strong> — Understanding how things are built changes how you evaluate and interact with manufactured objects.</p>

<h2 id="future-making">Future Making</h2>

<p>The intersection of climate technology, ocean systems, and community building offers rich opportunities for meaningful making. Projects that address environmental challenges while bringing people together around shared work.</p>

<p><em>Making things with your hands changes how you understand the world. Every manufactured object becomes a puzzle to solve rather than magic to accept.</em></p>
